Since I've removed the lines, I am basing my answers off the general trend of the points that have been plotted.

1. What is the general trend in the curve?
The trend of the points seem to linearly increase in accuracy on the tests as a highter percentage of data is used for training.

2. Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others?
Yes.

3. How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
The greater number of trials gives more accurate test sets. I've num_trials at [10,100,500, 100]. The points become more condensed with more trials. 500 trials gives a good profile.

Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10**-10)).  What happens? 
With a larger value of C, the points condense a lot. When C = .1, all data is used for training.
