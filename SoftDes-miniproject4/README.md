# SoftDes-miniproject4

This is our SoftDes interactive programing project. It is a game based on "One More Line" (but with Nyan Cat).
  The rules of the game are to not hit the walls or the circles. You can go around the circles by holding the mouse down. While in rotation, you're allowed to go through the walls but not through other circles. If you let go while outside of the walls, it will end in game over. When you have lost, the game window will exit. 

In order to run the game, just clone this repository and run the python script, maingame.py. 

The game requires pygame, random, and time as external libraries. 

Have fun!
