I'll be honest here, I'm feeling like I'm going to burn out and it's only day 2 (really day 1 for me).

Look around. There are always ways to make money.
And if you drop a class at this point, I think that's making a decision and planning ahead, not failing already.

Restaurants also pay more per hour than on-campus jobs fyi (at least $10). And you can theoretically work up to 20 a week, depending on the place.

Tutoring in Needham and Wellesley is highly lucrative (think at *least *$30
per hour, and often much more). If you got into Olin, you are probably
qualified to tutor high school math and SAT math prep (and possibly other
subjects too).

I'm curious as to  how tables can be banned but not cups. Cups, as we all know, are the number one alcohol consumption device the world over, eclipsing beer balls and funnels by a large margin. What is the Olin administration doing to combat this scourge?

Some of this stuff was already part of Olin policy--like the central source rule except for the part that gives OSL a blank check to declare "central sources"--and they're now actually telling us about it. But some of it--I'm lookin at you, Permissible Quantities--seems out of left field.

Did something happen that sparked the idea of new rules, or is it just OSL
arbitrarily deciding to suddenly become dicks about it?

(If there was an all-students email about it, I didn't get it - I'm not a
current student)

At the end of last year, manhall got a little entitled and OSL just wanted to make sure they had their backs covered in the handbook. Actual policy is not really changing at all it seems.

This is a classic problem in college football (not to name my name by that reference...) where for the coaches, this is a career and they have a system -- but, the players have a 25% turnover rate, and a good coach will adapt their system based on the players available.

In part, OSL doesn't see what we see -- they see a year that had a lot of perceived issues (whether they were actually issues is a totally separate point), and think they have to nip it in the bud.  In reality, however, the attitude they were hoping to change has almost all graduated.  That's why they're talking about "re-buy in" from the students, and all this talk about pendulums.

OSL is strongly reacting and unintentionally creating a somewhat adversarial culture despite the fact that almost everyone agrees on the salient points of what needs to happen.

This isn't a value judgment on anyone in OSL, the school now, or the class of 2014 -- it's just where the disconnect seems to arise from.

The main reason Olin's alcohol policy is going down in writing is, as someone mentioned, a certain group of students who became belligerent about their privileges.  When OSL had to argue with a group of students who had overstepped their bounds, it puts OSL in a very awkward situation.  Remember that even if you don't like OSL, one of their functions is to protect us from Babo when we break the technical rules.  And even if you don't like Babo, one of the reasons they exist is to protect us from Needham police when we break the technical rules.  

The closer to home issues can be handled, the better for everybody.  So if there's an issue, it's better to sort it out with OSL with the least amount of arguing that is feasible.  Escalation is bad for everybody.  OSL was beginning to feel that they may not be able to prevent alcohol-related issues with certain belligerent students from escalating, so we have new language to prevent such debate.

The policy has not really changed; once first years have tips anyone at Olin is free to drink (responsibly) without persecution.  Just be smart, and remember that even if they're being dicks, OSL is actually on our side.  And you'd much rather deal with their dickishness than Babo or Needham Police.

This is a classic problem in college football (not to name my name by that reference...) where for the coaches, this is a career and they have a system -- but, the players have a 25% turnover rate, and a good coach will adapt their system based on the players available.

In part, OSL doesn't see what we see -- they see a year that had a lot of perceived issues (whether they were actually issues is a totally separate point), and think they have to nip it in the bud.  In reality, however, the attitude they were hoping to change has almost all graduated.  That's why they're talking about "re-buy in" from the students, and all this talk about pendulums.

OSL is strongly reacting and unintentionally creating a somewhat adversarial culture despite the fact that almost everyone agrees on the salient points of what needs to happen.

This isn't a value judgment on anyone in OSL, the school now, or the class of 2014 -- it's just where the disconnect seems to arise from.

At the end of last year, manhall got a little entitled and OSL just wanted to make sure they had their backs covered in the handbook. Actual policy is not really changing at all it seems.

The main reason Olin's alcohol policy is going down in writing is, as someone mentioned, a certain group of students who became belligerent about their privileges.  When OSL had to argue with a group of students who had overstepped their bounds, it puts OSL in a very awkward situation.  Remember that even if you don't like OSL, one of their functions is to protect us from Babo when we break the technical rules.  And even if you don't like Babo, one of the reasons they exist is to protect us from Needham police when we break the technical rules.

The bulk of  the language is added as a judicial strengthening for OSL.
Like most legal statutes it's not written with the declarative intent to
enforce universally but to provide the *capability* of discretionary
enforcement. Don't interpret it as clamping down but instead as the want of
OSL to build themselves a better legal (legal = within Olin's jurisdiction)
toolbox to go after people being idiots. (To build upon caselaw that they
have had trouble with, they are now able to take your keg and you can't
whine about it)

If you read it carefully they have actually eased the restrictions on
single sources, you are now at least able to get "permission" whereas in
the past there was a blanket ban.

Also worth noting, they're not going to come out and say any of that. All
of their literature and guides must be on the right side of the law and
must lay out reasonable defenses against claims of negligence on behalf of
the university. (i.e. they said what they said as a preemptive legal
defense and to allow them to take away kegs when you're being idiotic)

However, pay careful attention to the fact that they are not actively
"enforcing" these existing Olin defined regulations (Most of what they said
was already against "the rules"). In this case and cases like it it is in
all our best interest to not freak out and ask for lots of clarification
because Olin is bound by Civil and criminal law to tell us that they will
be as stringent and protectionist as possible. Ambiguity is both our and
their friend in this case.

It is two thousand and fucking fourteen, and I shouldn't be required to store a bunch of archive files on my computer in order to make up for the pitiful lack of space that's part of my 40k tuition.

Plus, what if you need an email later? You have to dig through your 180 days worth of archive files, open up the ones you think have the emails, then pick out that particular email. 

All the while every email from SAC or whatever has massive images/attachments and the fucking freshmen all have email signatures wit the olin logo in it and it all eats into my quota instead of being something I don't have to micromanage.

And yes, I am fucking mad.

Just become amazing at the Outlook search feature. Also, you can archive to an existing archive file. I have one archive file that has 42000 emails from my inbox, basically since the beginning of freshman year (of course, that names me as a 2016er...)

Also, people should set plaintext as their default email mode. Some mailing lists (like the anon ones) strip down to plaintext no matter what, and do people REALLY need formatting for emails?

First years, ya'll should get some better email signatures.

While we're getting angry about emails, it's a total dick move for IT to
disable your network account and delete your email address with no warning
the second that you go on medical leave, and then conveniently "forget" to
re-enable it once you're a student again. It's not like my professors
needed to send me emails or anything...

My recollection is that the Public's drive space is automatically scaled up or down based on space. Plus, that data is very much double tripple RAID secured or whatever. I bet same with our email.

Shouldn't mean that we're perpetually out of space. Storage is still cheap. Fuck, if it's a money issue, divert like ten or twenty dollars out of our Student Activities fund. Then we serve two puposes. Less flashy money burning events AND more drive space. Everybody wins!

What I've heard is that we don't switch because if we switched, IT would have to downsize -- which means firing people.

Don't know if it's true, but it's kinda concerning to me that it might be.

Also, plus-fucking-one on the goddamn picture signatures.  What kills storage space is the hundreds of emails that are 50-100 kB.  Who the fuck came up with the picture signature thing, anyway?  I only started seeing it midway through last year.

My recollection is that the Public's drive space is automatically scaled up or down based on space. Plus, that data is very much double tripple RAID secured or whatever. I bet same with our email.

Shouldn't mean that we're perpetually out of space. Storage is still cheap. Fuck, if it's a money issue, divert like ten or twenty dollars out of our Student Activities fund. Then we serve two puposes. Less flashy money burning events AND more drive space. Everybody wins!

While we're getting angry about emails, it's a total dick move for IT to disable your network account and delete your email address with no warning the second that you go on medical leave, and then conveniently "forget" to re-enable it once you're a student again. It's not like my professors needed to send me emails or anything...

What if we made it email culture to embed emails instead of attaching them to the... OH I KNOW WHY WE CANT DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE USING A MAIL CLIENT THATS FUCKING ANCIENT THAT MAKES YOUR SMILIES INTO J'S WHEN YOU SEND AN EMAIL TO ANY OTHER MODERN EMAIL CLIENT.

FUCK OUTLOOK, FUCK EXCHANGE, AND FUCK MY 250MB INBOX

but for serious we should probably stop putting images in emails in general. link to it or have it loaded via an html embed.

but seriously tho.

Just forward your email to Gmail! It's still ridiculous that we should have
to do that rather than having Google Apps by default, but I switched 2
years ago and have been so happy ever since. A lot of people I know do it
and nobody has a problem with the forwarding process. Plus, if we get
enough people to forward, it makes a very convincing case for Olin to
switch to Apps. Go do it right now, there's really no reason not to.

See, I like have seperate email accounts though... I know that you can filter emails that come forwarded, but I still would rather keep the same email account. Plus, I find that Google's calandar is really lacking in comparison. Gcal + gmail are not integrated in the way that I'd like them to be.

Olin will never switch to Google Apps (or whatever Microsoft is calling 
their equivalent nowadays, though nobody asked for that) while IT is 
under its current management.  I've heard comments from certain people 
in the IT staff that they may in fact stop offering forwarding if 
significantly more people do it.  (Obviously, take this with a 
boulder-size grain of salt, but that's the way they think.)

Do you have any knowledge as to why that is? If this is the case, and we
can confirm that a majority of students would prefer Apps, then we should
organize a student-led push to switch (potentially also involving OSL to
get their take on it).

Subject: [Therapy] New Dining Hall Hours
Message-ID: <mailman.211.1410818510.1325.therapy@lists.olin.edu>

So the dining hall has changed its weekend hours so that they don't have
anything except fruit and coffee until 11 - the main area is shut in the
mornings this year. Is anyone else pissed off by this? I get up early for
meetings and don't like being denied breakfast. All I want is some cream
cheese for my bagel and a glass of OJ...

Dave has failed to respond to my email on the subject, and I'm really quite
annoyed.

This sounds like a topic appropriate for Dininghall-Discussion!

What incentive does the dining hall have to appease the students?  Everyone
who lives on campus is required to buy a meal plan, they can only offer
food between 2 and 3am and be closed the whole day and there's nothing you
can do about it.

If enough complaints get back to the school they would change dining hall companies, especially if it affected academic performance.

They have the continuation of their contract. If sodexo pisses off Olin students, then the Olin administration will (presumably) be angry as well, and there goes Sodexo's contract and continued business with the school.

Dave has also failed to respond to my email on the subject.

Also, olindining.com says that they should be open at 10:30 but they
definitely weren't open until like 11:10 yesterday.

Regarding switching to Gmail, that is still only a sort-of fix. Olin runs on Outlook. If you forward to Gmail, Outlook calendars aren?t viewable by others. This used to not be a problem, but then google stopped supporting syncing with Exchange.

Possible.  The only reason I can remember being explicitly mentioned is a bogus concern about security.  (Seriously, who's more likely to be on top of things, Google's security team or Olin IT?) On 9/15/2014 5:57 PM, Anonymous rants and raves. wrote:

Super dumb. We should honestly press IT on this issue.

Also, can we, as students, prevent this type of shit from happening? Instead of using attachments, fucking host your images elsewhere.

http://www.anony.ws/i/2014/09/18/whattheshit.png

This is all from just MAILING LISTS because people think it's OK to attach a shit ton of high res pictures to their emails. Not to mention all the stuff that comes though All Students that's just bloated to all hell.

Why isn't this in OIE? I'll take 1 class on "How Not to be a Fuckwit with Technology". 

Maybe it should just be "How Not to be a Fuckwit". I think a number of Olin students might gain something from such a class.

Possible.  The only reason I can remember being explicitly mentioned is
a bogus concern about security.  (Seriously, who's more likely to be on
top of things, Google's security team or Olin IT?)

Proposed change: email size times number of people email sent to is
automatically subtracted from your inbox limit.

Also, mailing lists are text-only.

I'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  Although we
can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than Olin's
webmail), so I'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that I'll
stop being able to send emails when I hit 2GB (I currently have 38 emails
totaling 3.24MB).  There's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which I assume
pays for everything IT related.  Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't
coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that
specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a
general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 If they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't
Olin?

Anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing
lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox
limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list
after IT's deleted your email account.  You still will need to deal with
the idiots who send All Students emails with 100MB attachments, but it's
easy enough to send all All Students emails to a folder that's archived on
a regular basis.

posing this to therapy because I figure we should talk about this shit. say an event happens on campus, put together by a student group.
say I think that event is a waste of our student activities fund, and want to express my outrage on therapy.
is it naming names because said event was put on by a student group, and is linked to a knowable subset of the olin population?
or lets say an email is sent out to a list or to all students, and a person is fed up with emails of that sort and decides to post to therapy.
since the email is recent on everyone's minds, it's pretty clear that names are being named, even if the general topic is something that's worthy of being ranted about.

tl;dr
therapy, at what point is the line drawn for discussing a thing and discussing a person/people?

I think the general consensus is not to post anything about someone who
could be identified by the post, even if you don't directly say their
name.  As for the line between discussing a thing and discussing a person,
it really depends on what your criticism is.  I view it as fine to say
"that event sucked", but not "that event sucked, why did the people running
it do such a bad job", but other people might not be okay with the former.
So basically better safe than sorry, if you're really pissed off about
something but concerned about naming names type it into an email that you
send to yourself, or your friend who you know's okay with receiving emails
like that, or type in a random gmail address to make a stranger's day a bit
more interesting.

Tangentially related, as someone who is involved with leadership in a
student group, I value feedback and would like to hear about it. I'd rather
hear about it in person than through an anonymous mailing list, but I'd
rather hear it on a mailing list than not at all. YMMV.

Tangentially related, as someone who is involved with leadership in a student group, I value feedback and would like to hear about it. I'd rather hear about it in person than through an anonymous mailing list, but I'd rather hear it on a mailing list than not at all. YMMV.

It's hard to be alone

It's hard to feel like it will never get better

And telling myself it'll get better doesn't help because
it's not that I think it can't

It's that there are so many hurdles
So much pain

So much that no one can understand
Even though I want them to

Even though I try to shrug off some of it
To pass it on
To say

Hey
Please take some of this for me

I can't do it all by myself

Please

But it doesn't work that way
Life doesn't work that way

Life is hard

Subject: Re: [Therapy] Fuck Inbox Limits

I'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  Although we can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than Olin's webmail), so I'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that I'll stop being able to send emails when I hit 2GB (I currently have 38 emails totaling 3.24MB).  There's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which I assume pays for everything IT related.  Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 If they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't Olin?

Anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list after IT's deleted your email account.  You still will need to deal with the idiots who send All Students emails with 100MB attachments, but it's easy enough to send all All Students emails to a folder that's archived on a regular basis.

Subject: Re: [Therapy] Fuck Inbox Limits

I'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  Although we can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than Olin's webmail), so I'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that I'll stop being able to send emails when I hit 2GB (I currently have 38 emails totaling 3.24MB).  There's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which I assume pays for everything IT related.  Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 If they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't Olin?

Anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list after IT's deleted your email account.  You still will need to deal with the idiots who send All Students emails with 100MB attachments, but it's easy enough to send all All Students emails to a folder that's archived on a regular basis.

Less servers + less staff = big money savings.

Well, probably not HUGE, but probably at least 100k a year.

Which is a start.

I mean, we did just do a network upgrade that cost us a few million, and no amount of Google Apps would have really paid for that. But that's a once-per-ten-years cost, not an annual budget thing.

I'd like to see the IT budget though and actually calculate this out.

Less servers + less staff = big money savings.

Well, probably not HUGE, but probably at least 100k a year.

Which is a start.

I mean, we did just do a network upgrade that cost us a few million, and no amount of Google Apps would have really paid for that. But that's a once-per-ten-years cost, not an annual budget thing.

I'd like to see the IT budget though and actually calculate this out.

Subject: Re: [Therapy] Fuck Inbox Limits

I'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  Although we can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than Olin's webmail), so I'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that I'll stop being able to send emails when I hit 2GB (I currently have 38 emails totaling 3.24MB).  There's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which I assume pays for everything IT related.  Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 If they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't Olin?

Anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list after IT's deleted your email account.  You still will need to deal with the idiots who send All Students emails with 100MB attachments, but it's easy enough to send all All Students emails to a folder that's archived on a regular basis.

Less servers + less staff = big money savings.

Well, probably not HUGE, but probably at least 100k a year.

Which is a start.

I mean, we did just do a network upgrade that cost us a few million, and no amount of Google Apps would have really paid for that. But that's a once-per-ten-years cost, not an annual budget thing.

I'd like to see the IT budget though and actually calculate this out.

Subject: Re: [Therapy] Fuck Inbox Limits

I'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  Although we can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than Olin's webmail), so I'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that I'll stop being able to send emails when I hit 2GB (I currently have 38 emails totaling 3.24MB).  There's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which I assume pays for everything IT related.  Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 If they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't Olin?

Anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list after IT's deleted your email account.  You still will need to deal with the idiots who send All Students emails with 100MB attachments, but it's easy enough to send all All Students emails to a folder that's archived on a regular basis.

Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.

It's possible that "Expenses" does not include salaries, which is a phenomenon I've seen in other institutions' financial reports.

Less servers + less staff = big money savings.

Well, probably not HUGE, but probably at least 100k a year.

Which is a start.

I mean, we did just do a network upgrade that cost us a few million, and no amount of Google Apps would have really paid for that. But that's a once-per-ten-years cost, not an annual budget thing.

I'd like to see the IT budget though and actually calculate this out.

I'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  Although we can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than Olin's webmail), so I'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that I'll stop being able to send emails when I hit 2GB (I currently have 38 emails totaling 3.24MB).  There's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which I assume pays for everything IT related.  Tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that specializes in technology, or even a school that's STEM-focused - it's a general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 If they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't Olin?

Anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list after IT's deleted your email account.  You still will need to deal with the idiots who send All Students emails with 100MB attachments, but it's easy enough to send all All Students emails to a folder that's archived on a regular basis.
