Have you walked through tall (like, ankle/knee height) grass lately? Have you rubbed your naked body on the ground in Parcel B? Then you might want to check yourself.

Otherwise? You're fine.

You're probably more likely to get cancer. Srsly. [Citation Needed]

I had lyme disease when I was like five. As long as you catch it early and go on antibiotics, it's not scary at all.
