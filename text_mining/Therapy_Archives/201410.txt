The fire alarm panel said it came from the "stairway 3 corridor" so that's at least different and interesting

Current consensus was a pull in the 3N hallway.

We're not "better than this", get off your high horse. Olin is a large group of people. This drink-the-kool-aid idea that we have this burden to be "better" than everyone else...it's annoying and condescending.

Olin exceptionalism, it's wearing me thin.

I mean, anyone should know better than to PULL THE FIRE ALARM in the middle of the night. That's not cool not matter where you are.

As someone who was awake and in 3 North at the time the alarm was pulled, I can assure that it was not pulled in this hallway. Not sure where this hypothetical consensus came from but it is false

David,

That consensus came from AJ, so if you think it's erroneous, you should talk to him and Nick Tatar. 3N was only where they said it was pulled. No one said someone from 3N pulled it.

I was under the impression that it was actually pulled in 2N? From people who talked with the fire department about it.

So basically I think we can all agree that we're generally uninformed about it. It happened. It's over. And now we can move on with our lives.

David,

That consensus came from AJ, so if you think it's erroneous, you should talk to him and Nick Tatar. 3N was only where they said it was pulled. No one said someone from 3N pulled it.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

Fuck that.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

Tell that to the victims of ISIS.  Babies are sold in Nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  On the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.

This just in, no one is allowed to feel upset about something, because someone else has it worse.  Why aren't you telling the sex trade victims that hey, don't be upset, at least you weren't beheaded by ISIS

true, this fire alarm argument in particular is a little immature, but in general, don't tell people to suck it up because "someone has it worse" and it's not a "real problem"

Tell that to the victims of ISIS.  Babies are sold in Nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  On the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.

Fuck that.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

Fuck that.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

This just in, no one is allowed to feel upset about something, because someone else has it worse.  Why aren't you telling the sex trade victims that hey, don't be upset, at least you weren't beheaded by ISIS

true, this fire alarm argument in particular is a little immature, but in general, don't tell people to suck it up because "someone has it worse" and it's not a "real problem"

Tell that to the victims of ISIS.  Babies are sold in Nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  On the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.

Nobody said in general. The response was to a specific situation. Shooting down a response to a specific situation because it is not generalizable to all other situations is absurd.

Isis is also an Egyptian Goddess - friend of sinners, slaves, outcasts - the ideal mother and wife, mother of Horus - equivalent of Mary, mother of Jesus in ancient times who sewed her chopped up husband back together and became the most important deity because of her magic skills and general awesomeness around the time she was exported into other mythologies like Greek and Roman.

We should also use this as an opportunity to remember why we have this mailing list. 
A basic principle of Therapy is support--the opposite of shutting people's problems down. 
Nobody feels better when problems are belittled, or when rants are attributed to siracha on the nips. In fact, at least one person probably feels worse because of it.

This just in, no one is allowed to feel upset about something, because someone else has it worse.  Why aren't you telling the sex trade victims that hey, don't be upset, at least you weren't beheaded by ISIS

true, this fire alarm argument in particular is a little immature, but in general, don't tell people to suck it up because "someone has it worse" and it's not a "real problem"

Tell that to the victims of ISIS.  Babies are sold in Nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  On the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.

Fuck that.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

Let's just establish a general consensus - do not pull the fire alarm unless an emergency because it is disrespectful of other people, especially those who are sleeping, and anger is a perfectly acceptable + very normal emotion to feel, especially when disrespect is shown.

We should also use this as an opportunity to remember why we have this mailing list. 
A basic principle of Therapy is support--the opposite of shutting people's problems down. 
Nobody feels better when problems are belittled, or when rants are attributed to siracha on the nips. In fact, at least one person probably feels worse because of it.

This just in, no one is allowed to feel upset about something, because someone else has it worse.  Why aren't you telling the sex trade victims that hey, don't be upset, at least you weren't beheaded by ISIS

true, this fire alarm argument in particular is a little immature, but in general, don't tell people to suck it up because "someone has it worse" and it's not a "real problem"

Tell that to the victims of ISIS.  Babies are sold in Nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  On the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.

Fuck that.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

Let's just establish a general consensus - do not pull the fire alarm unless an emergency because it is disrespectful of other people, especially those who are sleeping, and anger is a perfectly acceptable + very normal emotion to feel, especially when disrespect is shown.

We should also use this as an opportunity to remember why we have this mailing list.
A basic principle of Therapy is support--the opposite of shutting people's problems down.
Nobody feels better when problems are belittled, or when rants are attributed to siracha on the nips. In fact, at least one person probably feels worse because of it.

This just in, no one is allowed to feel upset about something, because someone else has it worse.  Why aren't you telling the sex trade victims that hey, don't be upset, at least you weren't beheaded by ISIS

true, this fire alarm argument in particular is a little immature, but in general, don't tell people to suck it up because "someone has it worse" and it's not a "real problem"

Tell that to the victims of ISIS.  Babies are sold in Nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  On the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.

Im still fucking pissed. Don't tell me it's over cause it's not. That was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. Guess who is still sleep deprived today? Or is my sleep deprivation over? Don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. Someone fucked up and I had to suffer consequences from their actions. Fuck that

How about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. Yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.

There's no "right" answer to this and you really should do some research into the specifics of your situation. An appropriate starting salary is going to depend on a number of factors including what type of software development you're doing, where the job is located (it costs a lot more to live in Boston than in Wyoming), and the other benefits and perks that are offered. The link below is to a Workplace Stack Exchange question that has some pretty robust answers with regards to the sort of things you should consider.

The more I dig into Engineers Without Borders, the more I don't like. They aren't filing a full 990 or disclosing full financials, no site is willing or able to give them a full review...

I think we keep giving money to them because they have "Engineers" in their names, not because they're able to fulfill their mission.

I hope that SERV does more vetting of it's charity choices going forward, at least beyond just names being dropped. There was an issue last year where charities that either didn't exist or were very poorly documented  made it to voting, while charities that were much more legit had to be added later.

Hi, Ari here.

I'm sorry to hear that Engineers Without Borders is not as good a charity
as one would hope. They were the charity last year, but I think the Olin
Community has done a fairly good job of selecting different charities each
year. They've been different each year I've been at Olin, I think. (I don't
quite remember what it was my first year.)

SERV does a cursory evaluation of the charities that are nominated each
year, and unless we feel that a certain charity's values are not aligned
with the spirit of the Olin community, we put them through for the ballot.
We can try harder this year to screen the charities, and I'm glad this has
been brought to our attention, but as this is supposed to be an Olin
Community decision and not a SERV decision, we've tried to put as many
charities out to vote as we possibly could. I would hope that people do
their research before voting as well. Regardless, I can bring it up with
the board to see if we want to enlist a stricter criteria.

I'm not sure what you mean about the issue last year - I don't recall there
being any late changes made. I have the full list of charities that were on
the ballot if anyone is interested in seeing it.

To anyone who wants more of a say in which charities are put on the ballot
this year, we'll be meeting from 12:30-1:30 tomorrow (Friday) in the
Mezzanine to filter the responses that we've gotten, and you are more than
welcome to join us.

Thanks,
Ari

I think this is recent, they've started finally filing full 990s. However, even there, they receive over four and a half million in grants, and they end up spending around 50% of it on actually doing work (going by adding travel + their spending and adding a bit of overhead). That ratio is abysmal. This is Susan B Koman levels of horrid.

Can you explain what you mean by filing a full 990? They have *a* 990
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ewbgeneral/990%20-%202013.PDF> listed on their
site, and *a* copy of their financials
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ewbgeneral/2013%20Audited%20FS.pdf>... what
additional information constitutes full 990 or full financials?

Hey everyone,

If you have any more anonymous feedback on charities that you would like
the SERV board to consider this year as we create the ballot, please
respond to this thread before 12:30 today.

Much appreciated,
Ari

This happens to literally everyone at this school.  IDK if you're a first-year or if this is coming back again later on for you, but it's a version of Imposter Syndrome.  To get my head out of that space, I personally grabbed on to one thing I know I do super well and used it to ground myself as an "I'm good enough."  If you've got something like that, it's super helpful.

The short of it is that if you are here, you do deserve to be here.  You were smart enough to get to Candidates' Weekend, and you were friendly and excited enough to get past it, and then you decided that this school is a good fit for you, and now you're here.

Every other person at this school has felt like that at some point or another.  Even if you don't feel like you deserve to be here, you've made a difference to at least one person here, and you are a part of Olin, and you have made it here, and that's good enough for now.

For me, getting off campus helps a lot. It helps remind me what matters. I also set personal goals for myself. If I meet those, that makes me happy, and that's what matters. I take pride in my projects because they're cool, not because they're worse or better than other things. I don't compare myself to others. We're different and good at different things. 

Call home if home is a nice place for you. If not, there were probably people who cared about you in high school (teachers, parents, friends parents, religious leaders, coaches, neighbors, the cool guy from CVS). You can reach out to them.

Message-ID: <mailman.3616.1414112670.1325.therapy@lists.olin.edu>

So, in between "Breakfast in Bed" and the front page of reddit, it got me thinking...

How do ya'll feel about the dining hall? We pay a disgustingly large amount to the dining hall (2.6k per semester), which, according to my spitball math at ~20 meals a week for 16 weeks works out to around $8 per meal if you attend every meal. If you don't attend breakfast, it works out to ~11.5 dollars per meal.

That's a fair amount of dosh. Do you think you get the quality out for the money you put in? What should change? Should anything change?

OP would also like to remind you of the following pricing structure for A-la-carte meals.

Breakfast - $6.30 
Brunch/Lunch - $8.55 
Dinner - $10.75 
Special Meals - $12.40

Literally cheaper to buy a-la-carte instead of a meal plan.

What the fuck.

The reason I've always heard that a la carte meals were cheaper than our meal plan is because we have UNLIMITED meals.

The reason we're required to get the UNLIMITED meals is because they "don't want us to worry about food"

If getting a la carte meals were an option for students, you could reasonably have students who eat almost nothing to save money, and that's bad for all of us.

quit yo bitchin

but yes, calling someone a bitch demeans women and implies that a man is a woman, which is presumably insulting (in implying that a woman is worse than a man)

In a pedantic sense of the word, yes, I agree. That being said, the word
has entered the public lexicon as a general insult and I'm not sure that it
has that connotation unless you use it in specific ways.

In a pedantic sense of the word, yes, I agree. That being said, the word has entered the public lexicon as a general insult and I'm not sure that it has that connotation unless you use it in specific ways.

Okay, lets do the math.

According to Wolfram Alpha, there are 77 weekdays between September 3rd and December 21st. Let's take John/Jane Doe, our Olin student who arrives on campus the first day they can, and leaves campus the last day they can. They stay on campus the whole time, they eat every meal at the dining hall, etc. etc. Note that this includes Thanksgiving break, when the dining hall is closed.

At 77 weekdays and three meals a day, one day of meals A-la-carte comes out to $25.60, or around $8.5 dollars per meal. Therefore, to eat at Olin every day for all 77 weekdays costs $1971.20.

But wait! There are weekends! On weekends, there are two meals, brunch and dinner. That will run you $19.30 * 32 (weekend days) = $617.60.

Your total cost to eat at the dining hall literally every day for the fall semester: $2588.80

You pay each semester: $2600

Do you see what the problem is now? Every meal you "skip" (as well as breaks/school holidays) means that you're giving more and more money back to sodexo. And even assuming you attend every meal (even those they don't offer) they've got a 12 dollar edge on you. Granted, this does not account for "special meal" days (which add 1.65 per special meal if you purchase a-la-carte), but honestly, we're getting fucked over pretty hard.

So remember when you order your burrito or go out to lemon thai that you're not only spending however much it is for the food, you're also flushing another eight and a half bucks down sodexo's greedy gullet.

What. The. Fuck.

The reason I've always heard that a la carte meals were cheaper than our meal plan is because we have UNLIMITED meals.

The reason we're required to get the UNLIMITED meals is because they "don't want us to worry about food"

If getting a la carte meals were an option for students, you could reasonably have students who eat almost nothing to save money, and that's bad for all of us.

My math also does not account for holidays or other periods where the meals are reduced to two a day. This is a theoretical upper bound. YMMV.

I like the mathematical approach, but please realize that there is a lot of factors going on here.

1. When you don't eat, Sodexo still has to cook that food and this still costs money.
2. Sodexo cooks a wide variety of dishes (though few particularly well in my personal opinion).  Sure you can get an 8 dollar meal at Anna's, but they have optimized very heavily for one specific type of meal.
3. Olin has a small student body which makes the dining hall model particularly inefficient.
4. The cost of raw ingredients (particularly meat and fresh vegetables) is surprisingly high.  Do your research.

Maybe the dining hall model isn't the right choice for Olin.  What are some better solutions?

Two solutions I hear often that won't work:
1. Everyone just cooks their own food - dorm kitchens cannot support 300 people every day.
2. Opt in meal plan - Is not financially reasonable.  The number of students we have barely make the dining hall affordable for students.  With fewer students, they would most definitely have to raise the price per student, and would cycle into bad idea #1.  Also puts an unfair burden on the dorm kitchens, reduces homework time.

Some possibly reasonable ideas:
1. Catering instead of dining hall.
2. Eat at Trim if you don't like the Olin food.  It's 5 minutes away.
3. Order takeout / go out to eat when you want something yummy, eat at the dining hall the rest of the time.
