Double your whitespace.
Use good fonts
Remember: You can emphasize and de-emphasize text. Bold things you want to
call attention to. Grey out the things that are less important. Change
colors, sizes, etc to make an effect of having 2 (maybe 3) different types
of text that relate in purpose.
Don't use a ton of colors. Also, use colors that look good together. This
is a pretty great tool. https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ Oh, and
don't use black. Pick a dark grey or blue instead. Black just looks...
weird.
Look around for examples of design you like and copy them.

This is not my own advice... from an Olin alum Erik Kennedy's article here:
https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda.
It's a very good article, and though it's focused on app/website design, it
totally applies to print as well.

Lastly, I'd just make sure things are aligned. Even two things that are a
millimeter off are occasionally noticeable. The grid and the snaps on Adobe
are your friends.

You know what?

I'm don't with trying to get people to care about/be respectful of other people (both people they know or people they don't know). For now I'm done trying to convince people to consider someone else's side, I'm done trying to get people to have compassion.

I'm just going to try spending time with people who actually care, maybe sometime in the future I'll have time for trying to make change.

Sorry, friends, If you fall under one of these categories.

What is Carpe for, then? As far as I'm concerned it's just about "shar[ing] and learn[ing] how to better seize the day." 

I feel like being informed about / being called to action around a political rally falls into that category. Further discussion would definitely make more sense on a different list, but it's sometimes hard to draw the line between "event updates" and "further discussion." Regardless, it could be that general consensus is that Carpe is for something more nuanced and should be treated as such. What do you all think, particularly those of you who don't think that political calls to action are appropriate for carpe?

Gluttony was for calls to donuts. Plenty of Carpe messages are asking you to do things -- audition for plays, come to events, come to design reviews, help with charity events, eat food, etc.

I think it just feels different when Carpe requests appeal to personal or political values than when Carpe requests appeal to your stomach or sense of fun/adventure.

There's also a difference between inviting those who share your beliefs and preaching.  Say there was an "Olin pro-life group" -- I think it's totally appropriate for them to say "Come to a pro-life rally if you think it's important!" on Carpe -- I may disagree vehemently with them, but they have every right to send that email.

However, if they sent out "Come to a pro-life rally!" coupled with a link to a fire-and-brimstone anti-abortion rant, that seems like the kind of thing that it's reasonable to object to.  In my mind, the key is a carpe shouldn't be making a value judgment on an individual who disagrees with any part of the poster's platform.

I'd argue that there has been an upswing of public preaching lately, especially in the reply all emails that get sent.

I am of the opinion that politically focused events are something that should be more opt-in than carpe. I disagree that Carpe is truly open enough to allow a post like that without at least some level of private backlash, if not a more public one. In fact, I'm certain some would publicly reply all their disagreement. 

I don't feel comfortable having a highly trafficked mailing list be safe for only one perspective or view.

Nearly any political statement runs the risk of a degree of backlash -- I don't really care about that.  Differences of opinion are healthy, and I think Olin needs to get over the idea that disagreement with each other is bad.  In high school, some of my best friends had diametrically opposed political positions to me -- and I think that was healthy, it forced us both to think about our positions.  I hope Olin students can start to do the same thing.

I would argue the problem arises when something is sent to Carpe that comes across as an attack on a group of people -- that doesn't foster discussion, it shuts it down.  Fact is, if these issues had a simple answer, they'd already have been dealt with -- and only by talking about what's hard do we synthesize enough positions to move forward and make progress as a country.

I'd argue that there has been an upswing of public preaching lately, especially in the reply all emails that get sent.

I am of the opinion that politically focused events are something that should be more opt-in than carpe. I disagree that Carpe is truly open enough to allow a post like that without at least some level of private backlash, if not a more public one. In fact, I'm certain some would publicly reply all their disagreement. 

I don't feel comfortable having a highly trafficked mailing list be safe for only one perspective or view.

That is fine. I agree open discussion and discourse is healthy. But I argue that both Carpe is not the forum for this, and the "call-out" culture of public shaming needs to stop. No matter how well intentioned it might be, you do not reply all when you disagree with someone. All it does is galvanize those who agree and shut down other voices who dissent.

Hey everyone,

If anyone wants to come and talk to me about my emails to carpe about attending protests, I would love to talk. I'm around tonight or we can arrange a time. I think the bigger question is why political discourse makes people uncomfortable, rather than the age old debate about the "right" uses for the carpe mailing list.

"Information is the currency of democracy."

Having a place where people can speak up /and be heard by the community/ is
IMMENSELY important to a functioning community. Carpe has the lowest social
barrier of entry of any mailing list in which you can invite people to join
you in an activity. With the exception of Helpme, Carpediem has the biggest
set of unique email-senders. This means that there exists at Olin a
platform that people are comfortable speaking on, which is a huge step
toward open conversations. Second, it's one of the best-read mailing lists
at Olin (maybe the best? It's hard to determine if people really read their
emails), which means that it's a platform that people will be heard from.
The fact that carpe exists (regardless of its purpose) and is used in the
way it is used today means that people can share issues they care about
with others, and that others will really listen.

My first year, I sent an email to carpe about a voter education website. I
was met with a particularly nasty response that said "THIS IS NOT A CARPE.
WHERE IS MY FREE SHIT?" I subsequently got in a minor argument about what
carpe /is/, in which I referred to mailman.olin.edu:

?Carpediem: A mailing list for those who wish to share and learn how to
better seize the day.?

There are a thousand ways in which carpe can help people better seize the
day. But the best one /for people outside of olin/ is the one that opens
our minds to new ideas and concepts, political and otherwise.

That being said, a neutral point of view is often appreciated. Saying "Join
me and together we can rule the galaxy" is perhaps not as effective as
asking "I'm going to overthrow the emperor; would you care to join me?"
Inviting people to join you in doing something is totally within the scope
of Carpe, even if not everyone on carpe would like to do or approves of the
activity to which you are inviting them.

The short of it? Don't say politics is off-limits for Carpe. It's not, and
it shouldn't be.

mitch

PS, maybe it'd be a good idea to prohibit discussion on carpe? It seems
like discussion is not what people want, nor what is necessarily in the
scope of the list. Just a thought.

PPS, the most comprehensive survey of appropriate mailing list use was done
by me in the summer of 2013.
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gCDvF9thMsKNItf4IVIvJPlRHi-Wb9cUdrxCtrVFdyo/viewanalytics
has the results. It's not a perfect survey, but it has some interesting
conclusions, especially related to "what is an appropriate use of carpe?"

Hey. Question. I feel like many Oliners are made uncomfortable by disagreement and confrontation.
Would you rather:

a.       Be made uncomfortable by discussions on social/political topics with people who disagree with you?

b.      Avoid discussing these topics all together?
I'm asking this as a legitimate question.

I usually like to hear the opinions and be uncomfortable, but if I see other people becoming uncomfortable that makes me more uncomfortable than the original discussion would have. I guess I want to respect people who want to choose option B?

Can you elaborate on that? I'm legitimately curious, and the following questions are not meant to be an attack:
Do you think these conversations shouldn't happen? Or would you like them to happen, but just not me a part of them? 
Are there other ways that you inform yourself about controversial topics? Or do you prefer to stay uninformed?
If you prefer to stay uninformed, why?
Would you consider changing your opinions on controversial topics, and what would cause you to do so?

I'm informed through Facebook and stuff. I don't really care to discuss these things with Olin people cause most of these issues are things that even if we came to a conclusion it wouldn't change anything (in the real world, maybe we'd make an honor code clause or something).

Also I think the only thing that comes out of conversations like these is one person gets the other person to change their opinion, so that person feels shitty and the first person gets overconfident about their beliefs. At least, this is what happens anytime I've had conversations of this nature

Why would a conversation or conclusion not change anything in the real world? Doesn't change in the real world start with an individual?... Also, I think that at Olin, we choose whether or not we are part of the real world. When we choose to be a part of the real world, we can make little differences or little impacts. We can just as easily choose to keep it all in the Olin bubble too.

And why should one feel shitty for changing their opinion? Is there anything wrong with changing beliefs? The world moves and changes around us, so it makes sense that our beliefs would change too.

Also I think the only thing that comes out of conversations like these is one person gets the other person to change their opinion, so that person feels shitty and the first person gets overconfident about their beliefs. At least, this is what happens anytime I've had conversations of this nature

I don't think it's about discomfort.  I think it's about the fact that many of the most passionate at Olin fundamentally don't respect differing opinions. 

I love debate.  I love the idea of a meeting of the minds to try and talk out a better solution, and change views.

However, Olin is a community of extremists.  The fact that most of us agree with the liberal positions doesn't mean that our liberals aren't just as extreme and disrespectful as Tea Party conservatives.

And this is coming from a liberal -- just one who had conservative friends in high school, and knows what constructive political debate looks like.

I sometimes wonder if (and am told that) people think my views are too extreme, or that I express them too harshly. I have been told that it can scare/intimidate people or drive them away. I would like to address this idea of passionate people not respecting differing opinions. I can only speak for myself, so I will say what I believe. I feel strongly about issues where people are mistreated by society. This includes sexism, sexual assault, partner abuse, racism, etc. I feel that it is our duty as people (particularly if/when we are in the privileged, as opposed to oppressed, position) to stand up against those injustices. I will use the example of sexual assault because I think it is what I have been most vocal about on campus.

I speak passionately about sexual assault. I speak out about survivors' issues. I publicly have very little patience for questioning survivors or "playing devil's advocate". I WILL have these conversation in private when we have more time and can engage more fully. And I will hear people out during those conversations. Many people may be scared of saying the wrong thing and being judged. I won't do that. I am happy to both educate people and learn from them, because I do want to hear their (your) thoughts and opinions. However, when these conversations come up in public venues, I do not want to spend time entertaining ideas of survivors lying about assault or whether it's ok to make rape jokes. And I will take a stand against those, vocally, because I want to signal to the community, and to survivors in the community, that I will support them if they come forward. I am more concerned about hurting the feelings of survivors than I am about hurting the feelings of people who want to question survivors. I trust that this seems reasonable. I hope that people who may feel disrespected by this understand where I am coming from in acting that way.

I respect differing opinions. I enjoy having difficult conversations with people who have differing opinions. I think that's the only way for us (me included) to learn from one another. I want there to be controversial discourse at Olin. If you enjoy talking about some real shit, I would love to talk to you, even if you think we have different opinions. I will not jump down your throat if you disagree with me. I don't want people to worry about "saying the wrong thing". We're all learning about how we want to do/say things, and everyone is at a different stage in that process. I completely respect that, especially when people want to learn. That's fucking cool.

So yeah, come talk to me and others. People are often more passionate and aggressive (someone else's word, not mine) in public venues for the reasons I mentioned above. Let's talk with fewer people and I'd love to hear your thoughts and both ask and answer questions.

Kate

When you post to an anonymous list and sign your name, it effectively kills
a conversation by preventing others by responding without "naming names".

The purpose of an anonymous list is to promote anonymous discourse.
Don't kill a conversation you don't like by breaking the anonymity.

Even if the other person is wrong, there's nothing wrong with having the
discussion.

I was not signing my name because I disagreed with the other person. I was signing my name because I want to invite more conversation off the mailing list. How can I do that without identifying myself? I also think I made it clear that I specifically do like this conversation. My aim was not to kill it. And feel free to respond however you would even if you didn't know my name. You're still anonymous to me, and I don't expect you to break that.

I grew up in a house where I was actively told to shut up or received a lecture about how unpleasant I was to be around because I had differing opinions or kept "challenging" people what they believed. Years later, my family started getting upset as I increasingly ceased to "have" opinions and actively avoided their company. I was taught to not care because my own thoughts were irrelevant to the people around me - so why have them at all? And since I already knew what their beliefs, values, etc. were - it became boring and redundant to be around them because they were never people I could talk to unless I started sucking up and making them happy, or being "defiant" again to destroy the relationship we never really had.

I too am an extremist for the opinions I do have. They are not exactly things I can talk about with other people because I am lucky if I find people who agree with me. But my friends know what I believe and go with it. I know what they believe and go with it. We know arguing or trying to get the other to "our side" is not going to happen, and condemning the other for something we are both used to being ostracized for destroys trust and ultimately our relationship. If one of my friends starts a campaign for something though that I do not believe in (Let's say the "no more shoes" party), I do not feel obligated to go with it just because they are my friend. That would make me a hypocrite, and it would be unfair if I campaigned to get people to do something I was not convinced of myself (eg. shoes are useful in winter). I believe this is where most Oliners stand? 

But I could be wrong.... And I do not have a problem if I am. I have always loved how people are passionate about the things they are. I like learning about what other people think because I like learning. I like talking to people. I like finding out something about the world I did not know before. But I do not like people trying to 'change' what I believe, much less challenge it. Both warrant a mental attack, destroying your foundations so they can replace it with something new - which is ultimately an assault on identity. People will get defensive fast. (And there is the classic argument, the faster they are to defend, the more insecure they are - though you can also argue that maybe they've been attacked too many times and have wounds you are rubbing salt into). I for one probably will not say anything to stop the conflict before it starts. Why? Because I am content with I believe, I think it is right, and their assault on my "ripped apart from a socially isolated childhood only to be carefully re-established after going through hell with 4 split personalities to finally come to like who I am today, so you better believe I thought long and hard about it" identity is not welcome - and then they become the ignorant, uncooperative idiot who is wasting both our times. 

But I am willing to consent that there may be things wrong about it because there are many people who believe things I do not. It is hard to say who is ultimately correct without hard solid facts (or so I believe :P). Yeah, I play devil's advocate a LOT - because I am curious and ignorant, so I ask questions to help broaden my scope. I like when people ask me questions too, because it helps me reflect on what I believe and better articulate it for the future. I should make it clear though curiosity is not a challenge. I think devil's advocate gets a bad reputation for that. A lot of the time, the ignorance part translates to being rude or offensive, which I am hopefully getting better at.

Shutting up now....

We can just as easily choose to keep it all in the Olin bubble too.

And why should one feel shitty for changing their opinion? Is there anything wrong with changing beliefs? The world moves and changes around us, so it makes sense that our beliefs would change too.

(Someone who hasn't responded yet)
I'm informed through Facebook and stuff. I don't really care to discuss these things with Olin people cause most of these issues are things that even if we came to a conclusion it wouldn't change anything (in the real world, maybe we'd make an honor code clause or something).

Also I think the only thing that comes out of conversations like these is one person gets the other person to change their opinion, so that person feels shitty and the first person gets overconfident about their beliefs. At least, this is what happens anytime I've had conversations of this nature

You can totally respond to people who sign their names. There are just different standards because you're talking to a person, not spouting ideas. So you can disagree with an individual, but you probably shouldn't call them a shitting dicknipple or threaten to stab them with a frozen poop like people often do on Therapy.

When you post to an anonymous list and sign your name, it effectively kills a conversation by preventing others by responding without "naming names".

The purpose of an anonymous list is to promote anonymous discourse.
Don't kill a conversation you don't like by breaking the anonymity.

Even if the other person is wrong, there's nothing wrong with having the discussion.

Look, there's this wonderful thing in the world called the doctor-patient relationship. It's been enshrined into law, and it says that what you say to your doctor stays with your doctor unless you are threatening to hurt yourself or others.

I'm not telling you what to do. But I'm telling you that especially when dealing with your doctor, that is not someone you want to lie to. At all. Depression is like any other illness. If you had stomach ulcers and had to take a drug which aggravates stomach acid, you'd tell your doctor. If you were at risk of stroke, you wouldn't let your doctor give you medicine which might cause strokes.

It's tough to do. I know. But if you're fine with telling ~320 people anonymously this, you can tell your doctor.

Their solution to my inbox being "almost full"?

Send me another goddman email about it.

I'm scared to work there now. Even scarier: My soon-to-be boss is telling me "You might be working on Outlook Web Access, ever heard of it?"

Yes. And I'm afraid of what about it is keeping it from becoming anything useful.

Olin is using a hugely outdated version and the limit is mostly Olin's
fault.

Yeah current outlook web access is very... metro-y. And not horrible.
Actually kinda springy.
But so much of our storage limits are super arbitrary...
Why don't we just do Google Apps again?

I dunno why, but I haven't lately. I think I need to reduce my screen time before bed, because it's seriously fucking with my ability to stop thinking and stressing about every little thing that's on my mind. Anyone else like this?

<speculation>
The prevailing theory that has gone around on Therapy, SLAC, and by word of
mouth, is that the problem lies with IT. I don't believe that fellating
different companies plays into it as much - Google Apps for Education is
free and requires no hosting, so from just a company-vs-company standpoint,
there's a lot of undeniable advantages to switching. (Office 365 is the
same, but we're not using that.) People have previously cited security
concerns, potential loss of IT work, and similar as why we don't switch,
but my personal belief is that we haven't switched because nobody has taken
on the cause (or if they have, I haven't heard about it).

IT has a lot on their plate. My opinion is that they do a phenomenal job on
a lot of things at Olin - infrastructure, etc - and, as anyone who's done
sysadmin work before should know, it takes a hell of a lot more time than
you'd think to fix problems and migrate platforms. Switching to Apps would
be a lot of work. So would switching to 365. If there isn't a concrete push
to change the current system, they're unlikely to change it out of the blue
because of the cost and because there isn't a clear need.
</speculation>

That being said, I'm fully behind the idea of switching to a cloud-based
service (I mentioned that earlier this year when this came up.).

If you're serious about it and think we should take it on, email me.

If you're strongly opposed to switching, tell me why. So far, people have
mainly objected to loss of calendar functionality.
