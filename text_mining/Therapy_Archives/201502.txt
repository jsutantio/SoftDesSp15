Subject: [Therapy] A story in my life
Message-ID: <mailman.195.1422811116.1360.therapy@lists.olin.edu>

I had a really emotionally taxing dream last night, and I feel that I need to tell this story for some closure in my life. Most Olin people don't know this story - not because I don't want people to know, but because there's not really many situations where it would make sense to tell people. I think that if people at least know the following story, I won't feel like I'm keeping a secret. I'm keeping this anonymous for now cause I don't want to make a big deal of it - this is more for me to feel satisfied than for you all to figure out who I am.












I am the real slim shady.


Just kidding. Here's my story:
My dad died pretty recently. He died when I was 16, 3 days before my 17th birthday. He died of a heart attack the morning that he woke up to take my brother to the airport to take him to college for his freshman year. My brother saw him on the couch, and ran to my mother to tell her my dad had stopped breathing. 

This all happened very early in the morning. In my dream that morning, I heard ambulances in my dream and had dreamt he died in the exact situation that he did. I was woken up by my best friend's mom and my mom by my bed side. My mom, a very strong smart woman, had to leave the room when my friend's mom told me the news between small cries and sniffles. I had never before seen either of these women cry, nor have I since.

My dad was an awesome, fucking truly awesome person. He was just like one of those people who was just plain awesome. He was a fantastic father. I know some people have issues with their parents or don't have the best family lives. My dad was the pure perfect father. Period. He was a stay at home dad once he retired from selling his own business when I was very young, so he was very present in my life. And while he was a little overweight, he always made sure he would play with us even if it made him exhausted.

That day I went to volleyball after to try to get my mind off things. I walked around my house and tried to clean things up a little, I just felt like I had to do something. The whole day was a surreal blur, seeing people I hadn't seen in years in my house bringing my family food. That's one thing I remember clearly. Tons and tons of food.

At his funeral, I read a speech I had written onto his Facebook page. Sometimes I feel bad that I didn't write a better speech for the service. My mom couldn't finish her speech and my older brother had to finish it halfway through. The funeral hall had a capacity of around 600 people I believe, but as we walked out people were crowded into every space possible in and around the building. I talked to people for probably 4 hours after the service just so that I say hello to everyone.


I'm fucking pissed. Im just upset at life. There are so many things that we could have done. There are so many things that we did that I want to do again. I want him back in my life.

Last night I had a dream where, long story short, my mom died and I was with my dad. Same look, same personality, everything. And I felt happy, truly happy, for the first time in a while. And it sucks cause I'm crying again as I write this now cause this death was really fucking hard on me. We went to visit his grave as a family and I cried, and I just couldn't help myself. I think the worst part is that when my dad was alive, my mom was my favorite and he knew it.

And it isn't a competition on who's live is harder or anything, but I'm sick of the bullshit that people tell me about his death and how he's in a better place or life is hard or whatever. He didn't deserve to die. There are people that die that have accomplished their life and it's time, or might be bad people. My dad was a great person. He was the perfect father. And he's gone. And everyday I'm afraid that my mom might go too by freak accident, and I don't think I could live yet.

So that's my story. I feel much better writing this down because now it's real. It's on (electronic) paper and not just in my mind. Thank you for reading my story.

The school thought I was going to murder my parents because I wrote a short story based on "The Veldt" by Ray Bradbury. Never mind that it was a fucking assignment that you had to write a story in the style of one of the short stories we read as a class that year. Nope, definitely parent murder.

I remember crying more at the thought of my parents dying than anything else that day.

Basically parents dying sucks. I sometimes get in that shitty headspace where I wonder what it would be like if my parents died like, tomorrow. Definitely not good pre-bedtime thinking material.

I feel for ya, man. People die and they die at the wrong, most bullshit times. One of the best things to do is cherish that part of them that you remember, and carry it with you. Not a religious person, but a priest once said to me that every time someone dies, your memories and thoughts of them live on with you, and they live on within your children, and their children, and so on down the chain. So carry with you the best of your father, and share it with everyone, so that they too can keep him with themselves and pass it on.

I even looked at some of you straight in the eyes and saw you stare back.
And it was like 12:56 so clearly you weren't in a rush to class.

You all just fucking walked by and I know who each one of you is cause our school only has 300 fucking people.

What heartless fuckwits for not expressing the requisite amount of socially
appropriate sympathy for your beverage!

An upstanding person would have lapped the offending beverage off the
stairs and regurgitated it back in your cup.
An upstanding person would have immediately fetched you a replacement
beverage while you processed the emotional disturbance of the spill.
An upstanding person would have found the bastard responsible for the
shoddy beverage container design and murdered their family just to show
them what's what.
An upstanding person would have grabbed you and caressed your head as you
sobbed over your long lost liquid refreshment, whispering encouraging
platitudes in your ear.

Kids these days.

While we're on the topic of stair travesties and barely-anonymous complaints, why are there crutches just hanging out and why did everybody's favorite Rainbow Bear disappear? 

I'm sorry nobody helped, Brian. If I was there, I would have probably mumbled some amount of empathy, then given a half-hearted offer to get paper towels or something. My guess is that you just looked like you were on top of the situation and folks didn't want to a) make your day worse b) disenfranchise you by saying something that made it sound like you were incapable of cleaning up by yourself. May the rest of your day be much less entropic.

I want to do a practical joke on someone. Just a harmless joke that wont damage people or property. But I need some information.

What I want to do is flip the slider on the thermostat in someone's room to make the cold side actually warm and vice versa. Does anyone know how to take the covers of the thermostats off in the WH rooms? There are screws holding it into place but I have no idea how to pull the square case off.

I have permission from the person's roommate and once he's really confused for a day or two I'll switch it back. Please please help. This will be awesome.

Isn't the critical flaw with this prank assuming that the thermostat sliders are functional? Aren't the sliders just decorative?

Good luck,

I was about to say, I believe the thermostats are just a knob people can turn to do stuff. I'd take mine off the wall, but, ya know, I kinda don't want to. Maybe if I'm drunk.

There are, if I recall correctly, two clips on the left and right sides 
of the case holding it onto the wall.  They're not difficult to remove.

The slider in a WH thermostat is a potentiometer which I think is wired 
as a voltage divider.  Its output is wired into the wall, but I don't 
know whether the control unit actually does anything with that output.  
I do know that the temperature sensor inside the thermostat does control 
when the heat turns on.  (Don't put your computer right underneath the 
thermostat.  The warm air coming out will produce a false reading and 
the heat will never turn on.)

Bad news for the prankster is that you can't "flip the slider" because 
it contacts directly on the circuit board.

Don't take this the wrong way, but... 		so?

150,000 people die on average every day and most of them didn't get to go to Babson or Wellesley college. Why do these events matter at all to anyone here (unless you know them)? Are you going to worry about every person that dies every day?

Yeah, preventable deaths are still a pretty shitty thing, especially if it's potentially suicide (which means that there's a harmful and/or unsupportive structure happening in our society that should be addressed). 

Better to do what you can than go straight to nihilism and say fuck it nothing matters.

That moment when you realize that you're not going to really connect deeply with others while you're here (or maybe afterwards, but that's a big fat unknown). You've had it and lost it, and you've never felt a deeper loneliness, even while surrounded by friends, who care.

To be 100% fair, we haven't had a solid monday of classes for a while, so a lot of courses are very behind...


But it's still bullshit.

We shouldn't be complaining... we're at OLIN, where we can walk anywhere in
a hurricane or a blizzard and still be safe. We should be thankful to our
professors, who are home with their own kids and have a lot more on their
plates than we do as college students, since they are taking the time to
teach us even though it's a snow day.

Well said. But it does feel good to complain about it just a little in an anonymous forum.
I, for one, am grateful I don't go to Babson where some profs are apparently running snow day classes via WebEx.

We shouldn't be complaining... we're at OLIN, where we can walk anywhere in a hurricane or a blizzard and still be safe. We should be thankful to our professors, who are home with their own kids and have a lot more on their plates than we do as college students, since they are taking the time to teach us even though it's a snow day.

Therapy, I want to hear about the little things that are pissing you off. Nothing too big, this is about trivial shit.

Like, for instance, I hate how things are delivered to Olin, but it takes a day for me to get an email about it because when it is delivered, its actually delivered to the post office and not to Olin, and so facilities has to pick it up and bring it to Olin, but they visit in the mornings, and the packages are delivered by midday, so I have to wait an extra day on all of my Amazon Prime packages.

Fuck that shit.

Unfortunately, the brownies were covered in mold by the time I picked them

It seems that people never think to turn the damn lights off. Seriously, it's not that fucking hard, and it's pretty much the least you can do. Turn the lights off when you leave.

Do people just not care? It's kinda the first and easiest way to save energy, but pretty much every time I walk by, for example, the EH laundry room, several EH study rooms, or people's suites, nobody is there and all the lights are on. Jeez.

And no, not all of these places are on timers so don?t give me that shit.

When people make inaccurate assumptions about my characters. 

Like when a grown man talks to a child who admires him, that is "clearly" pedophilia. Or that the psychopathic, sadistic pervert who has no morals and is an immature adult child, but can get away with everything because he's really, really smart, is an extension of my inner self. Or that the fact that I write about killing people means I have bent up hatred for society, and the characters are people in my life I want to kill and what I wrote was out of spite. Worse case was I shared a summary of my book with a homophobic, who assumed one of the girls was a guy and I was writing a gay love story - a very brief fight ensued.

That said, I now have a female pedophile and a gay criminal married to a police officer included as some of the major characters. Give the people what they want.

When people don't let 'just because' be a non-offensive excuse.

Why didn't I do the homework? Not because I dislike the class, not because
I dislike you, not because I had anything better to do, just because.
Why didn't I get you a birthday present? Not because I forgot. Not because
I didn't have money/time. Just because.
Why does it seem like your team doesn't care? Not because they dislike the
project. Not because they're busy. Just because.

People forget that random shit is the cause of just about everything, and
always try to be so damn deterministic. It's frustrating when I'm trying to
explain my actions and I'm not allowed to have the answer 'there is no
reason'

There's a conversation happening on the Empower mailing list about a potential event idea, and I wanted to get some more opinions on it. Here's the basic idea, though any details can be discussed.

Students, faculty, and staff are invited to anonymously submit stories around the topics of consent, bad/embarrassing/whatever sexual experiences, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, relationships, partner abuse, harassment, etc. Anything in that space. During the actual event (maybe during SERV time?), people gather in a semi-private location on campus and volunteers read the stories. People are also welcome to read their own stories.

What do people think? Would you like to see something like this, or a variation of it, happen on campus? Would you attend? Would you submit a story?

I'd love to hear your thoughts :)
Kate

First it didn't open all the way, then you couldn't walk through with a backpack on, then it got caution-taped off, then it got snowed in. Looks like it's done for good this time.

RIP WH West door. You are dearly missed. Please pull a Jesus and resurrect in 3 days.

One day soon, we will awaken to blocked doors on all sides. It's already happening in the AC. The ground is literally rising up against us. Soon we'll all be trapped inside.

The lower level east wing door of East Hall also won't open because the ground has risen too much. I'm just grateful we've got upper-level windows that don't actually prevent people from jumping out of them and lots of snow to cushion our falls, so we probably won't be perma-stuck.

Dining hall, just because you put it on a plate, does not mean I will eat it.

If GRoW or whatever really wants to cut down on food waste, they'd put a stop this bullshit pre-plating business with crap I don't want to eat on it.

Like, you'd have a piece of meat or something, and you'd bundle it up with a shit ton of rice, or crappy root vegetables or whatever.

I understand it's more expensive, but I literally will take more plates and throw away more uneaten food because you think it's a good idea.

Hopefully they'll learn someday.

Probably not.

I love when my jaw dislocates because the food is so tough. I eat what my mother puts on my plate because it's delicious. I get more food than I want at the dining hall because I know some of it will be inedible, that I promptly throw away when I confirm that it is inedible.

Dining hall, just because you put it on a plate, does not mean I will eat it.

If GRoW or whatever really wants to cut down on food waste, they'd put a stop this bullshit pre-plating business with crap I don't want to eat on it.

Like, you'd have a piece of meat or something, and you'd bundle it up with a shit ton of rice, or crappy root vegetables or whatever.

I understand it's more expensive, but I literally will take more plates and throw away more uneaten food because you think it's a good idea.

Hopefully they'll learn someday.

Probably not.

How many comment cards have you both written in the past week? I'd suggest writing them often. I've been averaging 2-3 a week this semester (not because of these issues, but because as a vegetarian I've been forced to either eat cold raw tofu or go without significant protein for a meal about 2-3 times a week).

I love when my jaw dislocates because the food is so tough. I eat what my mother puts on my plate because it's delicious. I get more food than I want at the dining hall because I know some of it will be inedible, that I promptly throw away when I confirm that it is inedible.

I think that complaining directly to someone who you take issue with is
MUCH more productive than a) complaining on an anonymous mailing list and
b) actively trying to do the opposite of what they're trying to encourage
you to do just to spite them.

You're telling me that my desire to complain to a list designed for
complaining is wrong or antithetical to my intent? I'm glad to see we're
all on the fascist bandwagon here.

I actually don't know who was out there, but I support them trying to enjoy the snow that got shat all over us. 
I also don't know who OP is except some bitter sad person who can't stand the sounds of happiness.

Honestly, I think we should respect people's desire for quiet at late hours on a school night. Maybe 12:15am is early for some people but if OP is trying to sleep or work, I totally understand their annoyance at loud people.

I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that with the aid of the previous comment
we have formally renounced our dedication to any utilitarian strictures and
have instead fully entered our own assholes.

I was disappointed and upset to learn that this year's Design Challenge entails having the entire school run through the AC "screaming at the candidates".  (I was outside WH when it happened and heard it clearly across the campus.) I can only imagine the amount of unnecessary stress this caused. It's part of a larger, older trend where Olin students act artificially wacky for the Design Challenge.

I have to wonder what effect this has on how the candidates view us and our school. For a lot of these kids, this weekend is when they decide whether or not they want to come here.

As someone who used to have ligyrophobia, +1 for the stress.

And, this is a more minor complaint, but I think the Hunger Games theme is kinda tacky for an activity that's supposed to represent Olin.

I hated my candidates weekend for all of the over-the-top wackiness and excitement, and that was 4 years ago. The best part was hiding in the library during the interview time block and reading books quietly. I think we?re effectively narrowing to only the extroverts, but is that really good for Olin?

I?m glad I came here, but definitely wouldn?t have if I hadn?t revisited.

Can a few people talk to the candidates over dinner and collect actual
feedback? We could then share with the committee.

I think that?s true, if I wanted to make change I should have done something, but candidates weekends are still way too intimidating for me and I try to be as far away from them as possible even now four years later. I also don?t know if there is anything we can do given the key elements of the candidates weekend (such as the design build) to make it more welcoming to introverts. With no good ideas for how to change it, the best I can do is talk to candidates when they revisit and convince them that it?s ok to be an introvert here.

It would be nice if big decisions, such as the theme and rules were discussed in a more open way. For example, the Design Challenge committee could send a survey with their top three theme ideas. Maybe there could be a mailing list for general discussion of the rules and plan for how the challenge will happen? This would let a lot more people participate, open opportunities for more people to contribute--regardless of personality and time commitments, and make the whole process much more open and well communicated. This would help the design challenge accurately reflect the desires of the full Olin community, and current students not feel off-put by the process. I think the design challenge is something a lot of people care about. For a plethora of reasons, not that many people actually contribute. Anything we can do to lower the barrier to contribution and help ease the burden on those organizing it would be a positive change.

As someone who has been heavily involved in design challenge planning in 
previous years, I'd love to "lower the barrier to contribution" but I 
don't believe that either of these ideas would "ease the burden" on the 
organizers.  It's hard enough to come up with a single workable theme 
idea, so either the survey results would get ignored when the most 
popular idea doesn't work out, or else the planners would have to put in 
a lot of effort trying to save a bad idea just because it was popular.  
The discussion list would probably be less harmful, but I think it 
wouldn't make as much difference as you expect to how happy people are 
with the result.

Honestly, I don't mind the way the design challenge is planned. But I think in this case there's one particular thing--screaming--that people take issue with. I think it would be perfectly reasonable for someone to bring it up with the committee and I don't think it's one of those cases where if you want an opinion you should have been there in the planning stages. I'm fine with leaving most of it up to a committee, because I wouldn't have anticipated that they'd decide on something I disagree so strongly with. I think it's within our rights to respectfully suggest that they consider taking out that part of the challenge.

I think that's true, if I wanted to make change I should have done something, but candidates weekends are still way too intimidating for me and I try to be as far away from them as possible even now four years later. I also don't know if there is anything we can do given the key elements of the candidates weekend (such as the design build) to make it more welcoming to introverts. With no good ideas for how to change it, the best I can do is talk to candidates when they revisit and convince them that it's ok to be an introvert here.

The problem is that the planners this year clearly didn't do a very good job of putting themselves in the candidate's shoes.  There are two things that anyone who'd even bothered to put themselves in the frame of mind of an intimidated high school senior would have rejected about 10 seconds after they thought of it. 

- "Scream at the candidates" is very hazing-like.
- Hunger games, which is literally kids killing other kids, does exactly the opposite of what the design challenge should -- "We want you to collaborate, you're not competing with the other candidates!" is not the vibe you get from a hunger-games themed challenge.

I'm sure that the organizers put in a lot of work, but use a **tiny** bit of empathy and they should have realized that it's not themed in a friendly way.

Honestly, I don't mind the way the design challenge is planned. But I think in this case there's one particular thing--screaming--that people take issue with. I think it would be perfectly reasonable for someone to bring it up with the committee and I don't think it's one of those cases where if you want an opinion you should have been there in the planning stages. I'm fine with leaving most of it up to a committee, because I wouldn't have anticipated that they'd decide on something I disagree so strongly with. I think it's within our rights to respectfully suggest that they consider taking out that part of the challenge.

Also going to throw it out there, on the comment: "If you don't like something, then change it or be involved."
There are many things you may want to change - but there are physical limitations where stepping up to change everything is not sustainable anymore, and you have to start cherry picking your priorities.... 

That said, speaking up is close enough to doing something - and kudos to those who took the time to make the Design Challenge happen.

So I did talk with a few candidates over dinner and at the club fair.  Here's what I got from them:

- One candidate I talked to was very startled by the screaming and extremely confused when all of a sudden she was wet and only realized after that it was because people were throwing snow.  (As a side note, this was something I was extremely surprised to hear and seems really, really inappropriate to me, and I'm rather upset that that happened.)

- The same candidate said she figured this was some sort of hazing thing.  (Again, I'm not particularly happy about that.)

- A couple of candidates at dinner said that it felt like a really weird thing to be happening, but that they didn't particularly mind.  

- Other candidates that were around at dinner seemed uncomfortable to be talking about it.


Overall, this doesn't seem like it was a good experience for them.  Nobody seemed to care about the theme, but the screaming and surprising them seems like something that should go away for next weekend.  

I personally didn't join in on it, but I feel bad.  This seems like it wasn't a particularly good impression that we made, and it's not like we were trying to cause any harm, but that we kind of made a mistake making it happen.  Is there some way that we can send an email or something to the candidates and be just like, "Hey, we were kind of idiots.  We did this thing and we probably shouldn't have done that thing, and it wasn't the best way to introduce you to Olin.  We know this doesn't fix it, but we swear we're not jerks and if you're still at all potentially interested, please come visit us later on and we can show you the parts of Olin you might like better than what we have already."  I feel like that could mean a lot to the candidates that this affected.

Can a few people talk to the candidates over dinner and collect actual feedback? We could then share with the committee.

Hey guys.
Sounds like there's some good discussion here. I don't know if anyone on the design build committee is reading this thread, but it might be worth bringing up to see if other people feel this way. If anyone here has comments that they want passed on anonymously to someone on the committee, I'm willing to do it. 
Let me know.

- Adriana

Someone from the design challenge committee is reading this thread. We recognize that today got out of hand and are taking steps to make sure that it does not happen again. I think it's safe to say that the running through the building while yelling and acting crazy will not happen again (especially with snow - that wasn't cool either). Please believe me when I say that we spend a good deal of time organizing the design challenge and would like to make it a fun experience for everyone. I will pass along comments from this thread to the rest of  the committee.

Anonymous constructive comments are totally cool, but also, please don?t be shy about bringing any suggestions or comments directly to the design challenge organizers. We would love to hear your thoughts - both the good and the bad. Thank you all for your comments, and I hope we can restore your faith in the design challenge.

Hey guys.
Sounds like there's some good discussion here. I don't know if anyone on the design build committee is reading this thread, but it might be worth bringing up to see if other people feel this way. If anyone here has comments that they want passed on anonymously to someone on the committee, I'm willing to do it.

Subject: Re: [Therapy] "Scream at the candidates" and Design Challenge wackiness

So I did talk with a few candidates over dinner and at the club fair.  Here's what I got from them:

- One candidate I talked to was very startled by the screaming and extremely confused when all of a sudden she was wet and only realized after that it was because people were throwing snow.  (As a side note, this was something I was extremely surprised to hear and seems really, really inappropriate to me, and I'm rather upset that that happened.)

- The same candidate said she figured this was some sort of hazing thing.  (Again, I'm not particularly happy about that.)

- A couple of candidates at dinner said that it felt like a really weird thing to be happening, but that they didn't particularly mind.  

- Other candidates that were around at dinner seemed uncomfortable to be talking about it.


Overall, this doesn't seem like it was a good experience for them.  Nobody seemed to care about the theme, but the screaming and surprising them seems like something that should go away for next weekend.  

I personally didn't join in on it, but I feel bad.  This seems like it wasn't a particularly good impression that we made, and it's not like we were trying to cause any harm, but that we kind of made a mistake making it happen.
