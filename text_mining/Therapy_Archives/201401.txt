Was that totally necessary? I think it's fair to backlash against babsoners that are douchey. But do you need to mock them out of boredom too? Not cool.

Is there something else bothering you?
Is there something that sprung this comment on?

Making fun of a group of people because you find yourself superior is the equivalent of bulling. You're not better.

There are 350 Oliners, we do laundry on average probably once every two
weeks...which is ~ 700 loads a month. Assuming an hour a load, a $7K/month

And it was triggered by this service, which is not available here.

Never knew bullying had anything to do with superiority, I always assumed
it was the group aspect.

ref:
bul?ly
*verb*
gerund or present participle: *bullying*

   1. *1*.
   use superior strength or influence to intimidate (someone), typically to
   force him or her to do what one wants.

Subject: [Therapy] Emotional comfort in alone time (or rather, a lack of it)
Message-ID: <1bmqu8r82x7ohfa5p2eug65w.1390682095857@email.android.com>

Last year, I experienced depression. I spent a lot of time alone during it, and it was comforting.

Now, I want the emotional comfort of that alone time, because I'm not emotionally fulfilled. I'm not really depressed though, and the alone time isn't doin it for me. Hanging out with friends doesn't help either, because it's fun, but not fulfilling. I'm just unhappy that I'm not finding comfort in the things that used to comfort me.

The slightly more concerning part of this is that, in the past, I've turned to casual sex or unhealthily intense relationships for gratification, both of which seem bad. I want to be my own person.
