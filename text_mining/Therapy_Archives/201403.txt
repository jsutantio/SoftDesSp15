"There is no relationship between being intelligent and inheriting wealth."
[citation needed]

Given that intelligence is dependent on *environmental* as well as genetic
factors, the premise of this article's argument seems flawed.

I think Olin suffers from the same issues of having a rigorous application filter as any other high end school. You have to have good grades, you have to have good scores, you have to do cool things.

I'm from a poor family; my dad was a drug addict and an alcoholic, my mom worked any job she could get to try to take care of three kids. I took care of my siblings because my dad was either asleep or angry and violent any time he was hung-over or coming off a high, which was almost all the time. My dad's addiction ran over us, he would find a way to empty out the bank accounts or steal money and items from around the house to pawn for drugs. It meant that no matter how hard my mom worked, there was still no guarantee there would be food, or power, or even a home at the end of the day (empty cupboards and foreclosure notices are most of my memories from middle school and high school). And she didn't have a college education, so she was working minimum wage or less a lot of the time. If my dad hadn't been scraping the funds, we still would have been a family of five living just above the poverty line.

I was a high achiever academically, but I didn't have much outside that to put down on an application. My family didn't own a car and I went to a magnet program far from my home, so I didn't have the opportunity to do extracurriculars. I couldn't have afforded to do many, anyway. Even if that hadn't been the case, I would have been needed at home- there were two younger children that needed taking care of. I still looked good enough on paper that I was recruited by Ivy Leagues in the name of increasing income diversity. There were plenty of other smart kids around me that didn't, though. They'd been forced to drop out to help their families (I considered this, but my mom refused, knowing I'd never get out if I didn't finish school), or the situation got the best of them and they ended up on drugs or otherwise delinquent trying to find an escape, or they just didn't have the good luck that I had to be in a low income situation but with a parent who realized the importance of an education and sacrificed a lot to make sure her kids would get one. I didn't end up at an Ivy League because I didn't think I would fit in, and more importantly, I was advised that undergrad at an Ivy League probably wouldn't be that great of an experience- most of them care more about their grad students than their undergrads according to the people I'd talked to. I wanted to get a lot out of my undergrad, so Olin seemed like a great fit.

That being said, for all that Olin offers generous financial aid, I was offered better packages by other schools (including Harvard). Need based aid has not allowed me the ability to relax and enjoy college, or even focus exclusively on a learning experience. My expected contribution would ruin my family, even now that my dad's out of the picture. Every cent I make goes into paying for Olin. I'm going to leave with a small amount of debt and basically nothing in my bank account.

I think Olin's community makes it easier for people who are from different backgrounds to feel okay in a way not all schools do, and I think Olin pays more attention to the stories students tell than many schools, but I also think we still wouldn't look twice at candidates who didn't have top of the line qualifications but had to fight to get what they did have to show because of their situation. Somebody else might feel differently about this, though. And the same barriers that keep people from going to college elsewhere, like cost, and the fact that their families often need someone to take care of children or bring in additional income still apply to Olin.

I am seriously depressed and have been wanting to take my life for a while now.

It's getting to the point where I am starting to write up my last will and testament, and am selecting a way to go out.

There are still a few things that are keeping me here, but I sense that they won't keep me much longer.

I know what is causing this depression, and my attempts to resolve these issues have failed on numerous counts. I feel that my only course of action is to escape.

Please don't. If you aren't seeing a therapist, make an appointment at colony care. Talk it out with someone. They might be able to help you think of a new solution, or at least something else to focus on. If it's urgently looming, find a friend, or an R2. Even if it isn't urgent, maybe do that. Even if it's hard to tell sometimes, people care about you. They'll be happy to take away your means if you need it, or let you camp out in their room while you get stable. Barring that, check yourself into a hospital. I did it last year, it turned my life around after years of depression and suicidal thinking.

When did you start to feel this way? Did a specific event cause your
depression to come to this, the brink of suicide? How can we best
support you right now?

You're not alone in this. People care about you and are here for you.
And although we might not understand exactly how you feel, we want to
help. Your life is important to us!

If you don't feel like meeting somebody in person, or sharing this
deeply personal event with somebody you know, I'd recommend calling
8778708336, which is a suicide hotline. It's confidential and
non-judgmental, and it's helped me more than once. Sometimes it's good
to just talk about your situation with an actual person.

Celebration of the color "blue", it's history, the culture surrounding it, it's importance to the world, and the struggle it faces being such an unappreciated color in the spectrum of colors that can exist.

Did you know?

Blue is one of the component colors of RGB. Without blue, we would not be able to make all of the colors that you see on TV.

Hey,
It seems in not naming names my name's been named. If you'd like to talk with me about where this is going, please shoot me an email or find me in person.
Thanks,

in before naming names, because apparently if someone emails about something that makes it impossible to discuss anymore because it's naming names.

Can someone clarify naming names? Roomdraw is a stressful event. They didn't say anything about coordinators or other people involved, and in my mind there's pretty much nothing that can make it not suck to some extent.

Unless you meant the dick comment. In which case people are allowed to name their own names. Or Craigslist, which isn't really a thing that I've considered protected under the naming names thing.

Daily reminder that studies can say anything.

Meat Mondays, anyone?

Also they're full of shit. "Moreover, vegetarians are vaccinated less often than all other dietary habit groups (p = .005) and make use of preventive check-ups less frequently than subjects eating a carnivorous diet rich in fruits and vegetables (p = .033;"

Hmm, what might lead to worse health? Eating a vegetarian diet? OR NOT GETTING VACCINATED AND NOT GOING TO THE DOCTOR.

But let's ignore that and say we need to warn people about the health risks of a vegetarian diet. 

It sounds to me like they found a bunch of hippies who don't believe in modern medicine, and who also happen to be vegetarian. But really, I think further study is necessary before any conclusions can be drawn. 

And because I've been waiting for the chance: http://imgur.com/50tDn2y

My formatting didn't get through the filter. Imagine the second one italicized and the third one underlined and italicized and bolded.

"Our results revealed that a vegetarian diet is related to a lower BMI and less frequent alcohol consumption. Moreover, our results showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with poorer health (higher incidences of cancer, allergies, and mental health disorders), a higher need for health care, and poorer quality of life. Therefore, public health programs are needed in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors."

"Therefore, public health programs are needed in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors."

"Therefore, public health programs are needed in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors."

Can somebody explain what exactly public health programs are needed to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors?

I'm picturing something along the lines of putting vegans and other like-minded deviants in concentration camps.

And I'm concerned.
