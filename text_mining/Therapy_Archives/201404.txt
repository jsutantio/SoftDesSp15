I called them at 8:35
To schedule a taxi for 9
They said they'd come at 9:15
And I said "that'd be fine"

At 9:25 I called them again
To ask them why they were late
They said they'd be there in a few
And to just sit and wait

At 9:43 I was getting cold
My sister was getting mad
I called them back, they said 'wait more-
Five minutes, plus a tad'

At 10:06 our taxi arrived
We felt a little jipped
When we got off, my sister paid
And gave the guy a tip!

I've also had a terrible, terrible experience with Veteran's Taxi. I basically kept calling them, getting madder and madder and they could not give me a straight answer as to when a taxi might be able to come to me. Eventually I just gave up entirely and didn't get to do what I wanted to do. I would NEVER use them again.

Do you need it to graduate? Do you need good grades for grad school or something?

If you answered Yes and then No, remember, D is for Diploma.

Also, keep in mind that you can always retake a course and your new grade will completely cover the old one, whether or not it's a W or a D.

Oh, non Olin. 

My thought then is to think about what story you want to tell to an employer who asks about it? Did you just want to focus on other things, so you withdrew? Did you want to stick it out to the end anyways, even if it gets you a bad grade? As long as you can decently justify it a decent employer or whatever won't think that much less of you.

There are thousands of engineering companies within a 10 mile radius of
Olin.

Start writing some e-mails asking for meetings with senior folks at those
companies and start picking up the phone for the same. They might be older
and stodgier than you want but if you're looking for resume building, take
what you can get and lever it up.

Take a day, make your strong coffee, and start contacting people. (Fuck HR
departments, useless troglodytes)

Watch out for the landmine of "grades don't matter."

Even though we're awesome and we all know that, some places do still have a GPA cutoff - if you don't hit the mark, they won't even give you a chance to explain away the blemish. Go for the W - then at least you get the chance to talk about it.

Lot B is primarily for students who use their car frequently, especially for students who need to drive to classes at Wellesley or Brandeis. For someone who is driving to class every day, it's much more of a burden to walk back and forth to lots A and C compared to the person who drives once a week.

A good rule of thumb is that if you don't know you'll be using your car in the next 48 hours, don't park in Lot B. 

That being said, it's not like anyone will ticket you or kick you out. You are just being an asshole and you should feel bad.

Lot B is primarily for students who use their car frequently, especially for students who need to drive to classes at Wellesley or Brandeis. For someone who is driving to class every day, it's much more of a burden to walk back and forth to lots A and C compared to the person who drives once a week.

A good rule of thumb is that if you don't know you'll be using your car in the next 48 hours, don't park in Lot B. 

That being said, it's not like anyone will ticket you or kick you out. You are just being an asshole and you should feel bad.

Lot B is only for people living in East Hall.

And only for people with dark hair, as it the burden of excess sun exposure
is larger for them.

Subject: [Therapy] Frustrated
Message-ID: <CAHyAjSiiwo4EH9AkT6bEzQ4Xt9JyMeS7ewH4YN0hgBUUneC_Sg@mail.gmail.com>

I was heavily abused by my parents, neighbors, and caretakers as a child.

I was starved, made to act like a dog so that my family members could laugh
at me and abuse me both physically and mentally.

I was raped by a childhood friend, and I was molested by older children in
my neighborhood while my parents watched.

I was burnt by a number of babysitters that I had. In one particularly
violent attempt I believe one of my early caretakers attempted to castrate
me, but between a vague scar and a fuzzy memory I can't say for sure if
that was their true aim.

I made three suicide attempts before the age of 10, and at a later date
when a police investigation was launched, I was forced again to claim that
everything had been a lie, and that this had never happened.

I have been formally diagnosed with PTSD as a result of this history and
have a long list of neuroses which make it very difficult for me to
interact with people.

I have long assumed that nobody at Olin could relate to me, and I truly,
truly hope that I am wrong.

I'm in a tough spot and I would really love to be proven wrong, or just to
talk with someone. I feel like I've kept this in way too long, but I'm
fucking tired of not being able to talk about it.

Email me at totallyanoliner at gmail.com if I'm wrong.

This right here is exactly why you should always take a day to simmer down before sending angry emails.

1) Most of us have no idea what happened. Unless you were there and actually saw this shit go down, you're not qualified to rant about how embarrassing it was. As you probably found out when you got that first response, different people have different perspectives w/r/t this event, and mudslinging when you're not sure of the facts is unfair to the people involved. 

2) Even if the most commonly circulated account of the incident is correct - which is no sure thing - the person responsible already probably feels like shit. No one wants to cancel the spring formal. No one's sitting around with their buddies, knockin' back beers and bragging about that time they made a party end early. They don't need your anger to realize that they fucked up.  It's like telling an anorexic person that they need to eat more: I mean, sure, it's probably true, but don't you think they already know? You're not helping anyone. You're just making someone feel bad so that you can say you did your part as a contributing citizen.

3) Therapy has a "no naming names" rule for a reason. It's not just to protect reputations; it's to prevent people from sending anonymous hatemail. What you just sent out qualifies as anonymous hatemail. That's shitty. The rules don't stop applying to you because you think you're righteously angry.

The content and style of your email smack of a hastily composed flame message. Next time, please think longer and harder before hitting "send".

No, it does not count as naming names.

The survey does not slander anyone, and is not calling anyone out in
particular. It seems like an entirely appropriate survey, as far as I can
tell.

I answered. I am interested to see what comes of this.

I know I personally have opinions abound.

To clarify, you're saying that by sending this to a mailing list in which people are expected to be bitchy, you think people WILL be bitchy? 

I agree, I just want to make sure you're saying that Therapy is a bitchy group, not OSL (which was my original interpretation of your sentence)

Personally, I think everyone left on Therapy is only here because it makes their prostate tremble to tell people they're naming names.

Subject: [Therapy] Counting down
Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE40137A757DE10@EXVS01.olin.edu>

I thought about reading this at Speak.Easy. Due to its length and topic, I ended up going with something else. However, via a comment during the slam, this might be a more appropriate place for it. Completely self-centric and really messed up. :P

As a premise: I became suicidal around age 12. I have not been "officially suicidal" for a few years, but there is the occasional relapse, which is what these last few weeks have been. I wrote this a few days ago (with minor edits). Please note, I am perfectly sane and you should not be alarmed in any way.

---

When I was a kid, I had my dreams. Unrealistic. Bold. A bit unorthodox. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a shape shifter. I could be anything for anyone. I wanted to be "good at everything." I wanted to be the jack of all trades, but I would be different because I would be the master of all! It already seemed so easy, like I had a natural talent for everything I did. People encouraged me to pursue things, from sports to acting. From writing to math. Then on that fateful day, when I was 17 years old, I put down the rope I was going to hang myself with in a sobbing nervous breakdown of realization: I wanted to live. And I promised myself I would. One week later, I started filling out college applications.

Or so I tell people. The truth is, I hesitated. My plan was not perfect. I did not fully think it out. I did not know if my ceiling fan could hold my weight. I did not try attaching the noose to it. I did not even think about what chair I would kick out from under me. I am alive today because I was too uncertain to die. Too clingy to my precious little existence that I backed off.

Or so I tell people. The thing with memories you don't have is that you know what happened, but your own mind tosses them out the back door in some mock hope that it will help you get over it. I only remember that day as "D Day" - aptly marked in my agenda several weeks in advance. I only remember going to my mother and begging behind sobbing tears to let me take off a day from school. I only remember the morning after when I could not feel anything anymore. The truth is something inside of me died that day. Something I have never been able to get back. The fear that once consumed my life, the motivation that drove me to do my best. It was gone. And I had nothing left. I was nothing but a shell of a person, a slate wiped clean, a life that had to start over.

Or so I tell people. Sometime between 10 and 12 years old, she arrived. The funny thing is, if you are all alone, pinned down on the floor with some invisible force strangling you, you start crying out for help in the vast void of emptiness. But the problem with that is: something might just start talking back. I lived by the philosophy she began cramming into my head. Rules for how to live my life, how the world worked, and my measly place in it. Rules which became the truth I live by. Part of me wants them to be wrong. But she was right. She was always right. D-Day was the day her voice stopped, a day I was driven to because of one fact and one fact alone she taught me very well: People like me should not exist. Whether I was a monster who had to be silenced before he could hurt anyone. Whether he was a mass of existential waste that was destined to have no purpose. Whether he was a malfunctioning robot tossed out by aliens, because who wants a short circuiting piece of junk? Who wanted something broken when they could get something better. I was useless. Useless things should not exist. They only get in the way. The most I would ever be was a cricket in the corner. A shadow. A leech, hanging off other people's beck and call - and how pathetic was I? Incapable of living life on my own without dragging along on other people's apron strings. I was a stage extra.  It was nature. If I went against that, nothing would particularly happen, because you could never be what you never were. Like characters in a book, so beautifully designed for a specific purpose. The masked faces who were one in a hundred thousand bodies just so the hero could say they had an army. Some people were just meant to die.

I have never stopped wishing I had gone through with it. I have never gone a day without regretting that promise. I have never stopped being "suicidal." It is only a matter of time until it happens. I've gotten close on many occasions. End of my first year, I nearly jumped in front of a train. End of my junior year, I began making plans to wander off into parcel B right after I graduate. It's funny how easy it is to hide. I've gotten so used to it. The actor, the robot, who would notice? The loner, the freak of nature, who would care? And who had the time to breech a communication barrier of someone who had long stopped caring? Who'd twist and warp words into deliberate misunderstandings? A joke of a human who would laugh off anything. Who could not lie, but always did.

Some people can throw the argument of God. God loves you! Who cares? Then He'll understand me when I go to meet him. But I care about you! That's nothing but delusional empathy. You're human. You don't understand death - chances are you think it's bad or sad, so of course you would think that. Excuses, excuses, excuses. You can never guarantee life is going to get better. All you can guarantee is change. Change in a world where you don't know what will happen tomorrow. People go through hell to become what they are today, but for me, that hell has come and gone. Nothing's changed. It is not that I want to die. I want to live - I really want to live so, so much! You have no idea how much. But I know that some people just shouldn't. And I'm tired. Tired of being the person who just did not have what it takes. Tired of blindly wandering after dreams that are always just dreams. Tired of being some scrap-heap humiliation of a robot who lets everyone down. Tired - so, so tired - of her always being right. So when that day finally comes. When I don't have anywhere else to go, when my path runs out of road and all before me is nothing but a chasm of nothing - then I might just finally jump. She said I couldn't do it.

Hey. Thanks for your openness. Is there anything we can do to help or support you? You do have a community behind you that wants to see that you're safe and supported. Please let us know.

As a premise: I became suicidal around age 12. I have not been "officially suicidal" for a few years, but there is the occasional relapse, which is what these last few weeks have been. I wrote this a few days ago (with minor edits). Please note, I am perfectly sane and you should not be alarmed in any way.

---

When I was a kid, I had my dreams. Unrealistic. Bold. A bit unorthodox. When I was a kid, I wanted to be a shape shifter. I could be anything for anyone. I wanted to be "good at everything." I wanted to be the jack of all trades, but I would be different because I would be the master of all! It already seemed so easy, like I had a natural talent for everything I did. People encouraged me to pursue things, from sports to acting. From writing to math. Then on that fateful day, when I was 17 years old, I put down the rope I was going to hang myself with in a sobbing nervous breakdown of realization: I wanted to live. And I promised myself I would. One week later, I started filling out college applications.

Or so I tell people. The truth is, I hesitated. My plan was not perfect. I did not fully think it out. I did not know if my ceiling fan could hold my weight. I did not try attaching the noose to it. I did not even think about what chair I would kick out from under me. I am alive today because I was too uncertain to die. Too clingy to my precious little existence that I backed off.

Or so I tell people. The thing with memories you don't have is that you know what happened, but your own mind tosses them out the back door in some mock hope that it will help you get over it. I only remember that day as "D Day" - aptly marked in my agenda several weeks in advance. I only remember going to my mother and begging behind sobbing tears to let me take off a day from school. I only remember the morning after when I could not feel anything anymore. The truth is something inside of me died that day. Something I have never been able to get back. The fear that once consumed my life, the motivation that drove me to do my best. It was gone. And I had nothing left. I was nothing but a shell of a person, a slate wiped clean, a life that had to start over.

Or so I tell people. Sometime between 10 and 12 years old, she arrived. The funny thing is, if you are all alone, pinned down on the floor with some invisible force strangling you, you start crying out for help in the vast void of emptiness. But the problem with that is: something might just start talking back. I lived by the philosophy she began cramming into my head. Rules for how to live my life, how the world worked, and my measly place in it. Rules which became the truth I live by. Part of me wants them to be wrong. But she was right. She was always right. D-Day was the day her voice stopped, a day I was driven to because of one fact and one fact alone she taught me very well: People like me should not exist. Whether I was a monster who had to be silenced before he could hurt anyone. Whether he was a mass of existential waste that was destined to have no purpose. Whether he was a malfunctioning robot tossed out by aliens, because who wants a short circuiting piece of junk? Who wanted something broken when they could get something better. I was useless. Useless things should not exist. They only get in the way. The most I would ever be was a cricket in the corner. A shadow. A leech, hanging off other people's beck and call - and how pathetic was I? Incapable of living life on my own without dragging along on other people's apron strings. I was a stage extra.  It was nature. If I went against that, nothing would particularly happen, because you could never be what you never were. Like characters in a book, so beautifully designed for a specific purpose. The masked faces who were one in a hundred thousand bodies just so the hero could say they had an army. Some people were just meant to die.

I have never stopped wishing I had gone through with it. I have never gone a day without regretting that promise. I have never stopped being "suicidal." It is only a matter of time until it happens. I've gotten close on many occasions. End of my first year, I nearly jumped in front of a train. End of my junior year, I began making plans to wander off into parcel B right after I graduate. It's funny how easy it is to hide. I've gotten so used to it. The actor, the robot, who would notice? The loner, the freak of nature, who would care? And who had the time to breech a communication barrier of someone who had long stopped caring? Who'd twist and warp words into deliberate misunderstandings? A joke of a human who would laugh off anything. Who could not lie, but always did.

Some people can throw the argument of God. God loves you! Who cares? Then He'll understand me when I go to meet him. But I care about you! That's nothing but delusional empathy. You're human. You don't understand death - chances are you think it's bad or sad, so of course you would think that. Excuses, excuses, excuses. You can never guarantee life is going to get better. All you can guarantee is change. Change in a world where you don't know what will happen tomorrow. People go through hell to become what they are today, but for me, that hell has come and gone. Nothing's changed. It is not that I want to die. I want to live - I really want to live so, so much! You have no idea how much. But I know that some people just shouldn't. And I'm tired. Tired of being the person who just did not have what it takes. Tired of blindly wandering after dreams that are always just dreams. Tired of being some scrap-heap humiliation of a robot who lets everyone down. Tired - so, so tired - of her always being right. So when that day finally comes. When I don't have anywhere else to go, when my path runs out of road and all before me is nothing but a chasm of nothing - then I might just finally jump. She said I couldn't do it.

I am safe. Nothing I know anyone can do - it's a passing phase until another trigger comes along. I can't really talk about it to anyone in person because either my voice shuts down or I can get really, really hostile (especially when I've "gotten over it"). Right now I am in the "getting over it" part. So I'll probably start denying everything I said pretty soon....
