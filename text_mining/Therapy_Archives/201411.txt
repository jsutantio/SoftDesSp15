So long as we're ranting about things people are irrationally angry about (the point of the list, amirite?), the bigger issue here is the word "olingate".

Adding "-gate" to the end of scandals stopped being cool when Nixon left office.  The fact that it isn't even a scandal only makes it worse.

So when the media runs a feature on jumping off a bridge you should to?

"-Gate" is dumb. And it's stupid. And it's dumb.

Best part about Japan. Miso soup at every meal. And if you're not having miso, you're having ramen.

You know what I hate? When people that you work with INSIST on doing things on the computer, but then the stuff that they make looks SHITTY.

Like, draw it or let somebody who's good at visual layout do things. I don't want to have to fix your shit just because you don't fucking know how to ALIGN MARGINS.

Like seriously, FUCKING MARGINS.

And pictures just strewn throughout. No thought to overall visual appeal whatsoever. But then. BUT THEN. You say that we should make a poster. Or that we should make handouts. Or that we should FUCKING THROW OUT OUR HAND-DRAWN SHIT THAT LOOKS A THOUSAND PERCENT BETTER.

the worst crime is the fonts though.

How the fuck am I supposed to tell you to not mix serif and sans-serif fonts? How am I supposed to tell you that the 'cursive' font you've chosen looks like shit? How am I supposed to explain that 'hand-drawn' fonts look horrible in 90% of deployed products? HOW DO I TELL YOU THAT PEOPLE LAUGH WHEN YOU USE COMIC SANS.

Seriously, person. Learn some fucking visual design. Or at the very least, let me help you do the visual design. Because you have no direction. You don't know what looks good. It's almost like you're trying to avoid coherence.

And when you decide to take the lead on the visual layout, and don't take no for an answer, I'm pissed that I'm stuck with sending anonymous emails instead of confronting you.

Seriously? Get your own fucking campus. Why are the all here? And they're all dressed exactly the same. And they ruined the nice leaves in the O. They should just go away. And if they're so fucking cold then maybe they should put a coat on for their dumb pictures.

If it really pisses you off that much, call Babo and report gang activity in the O.  They're an exclusive club who all dress the same -- sounds like a gang to me.

Note:  Don't actually do this, it probably counts as filing a false police report.

I can't believe how ignorant Olin is.  Seriously guys, grow the fuck up.  We're so fucking exclusive, we can't even consider accepting people even a little different from the rest of.  How the fuck would you feel if Babson treated us that way? This is just sad, Babson is more fucking accepting of different and diverse people than we are.  Wake the fuck up assholes.

Yeah, I really don't think it's a problem that they're here. Like
seriously, who are they harming? The O is a great place for group pictures.
Babson doesn't have a well-lit place with trees and grass. It's not a big
fucking deal.

Are you fucking kidding me? This has nothing to do with being ignorant. If they went to this school here, that's fine. Take the fucking picture. But they don't pay for facilities to clean up the lawn and the O. Now they've left and they've also left their trash behind. Literally there are cups sitting in the O now. From our dining hall. Which we pay fuck tons of money for and they eat at. And this isn't the first example of Babson trashing our campus. Like the cars last year? Them breaking into our parties? And coloring on the walls in the dorms? Where do we draw the line for Babson students abusing our campus.

#NotAllBabsonStudents

But seriously, folks. The vast majority of Babson students don't even spend any significant time on our campus. Many who do are reasonably respectful, even if they have a different culture than ours. Some Babson students are dickheads, yes. But so are some Olin students. It's all about proportions and population sizes.

Are you fucking kidding me? This has nothing to do with being ignorant. If they went to this school here, that's fine. Take the fucking picture. But they don't pay for facilities to clean up the lawn and the O. Now they've left and they've also left their trash behind. Literally there are cups sitting in the O now. From our dining hall. Which we pay fuck tons of money for and they eat at. And this isn't the first example of Babson trashing our campus. Like the cars last year? Them breaking into our parties? And coloring on the walls in the dorms? Where do we draw the line for Babson students abusing our campus.

I can't believe how ignorant Olin is.  Seriously guys, grow the fuck up.  We're so fucking exclusive, we can't even consider accepting people even a little different from the rest of.  How the fuck would you feel if Babson treated us that way? This is just sad, Babson is more fucking accepting of different and diverse people than we are.  Wake the fuck up assholes.

Seriously? Get your own fucking campus. Why are the all here? And they're all dressed exactly the same. And they ruined the nice leaves in the O. They should just go away. And if they're so fucking cold then maybe they should put a coat on for their dumb pictures.

Let's build a bigger, better snowman this year. We should need ladders and ramps to finish it.

Don't tell people to calm down. Do you have any idea how degrading that is? Also, it may not be all Babson students but that doesn't change the fact that it's still a recurring problem. Let's take this problem seriously. Something needs to be done about this to make Olin feel like a safer place. Like the place I thought I was going when I applied. If I were a prospie and touring campus and saw a gang of identically dressed women in the O shivering taking these pictures, I'd think, "What the fuck? This is not the place for me." And I probably wouldn't have come here. Let's keep Olin at Olin and Babson at Babson. I didn't apply to Babson.

Don't tell people to calm down. Do you have any idea how degrading that is? Also, it may not be all Babson students but that doesn't change the fact that it's still a recurring problem. Let's take this problem seriously. Something needs to be done about this to make Olin feel like a safer place. Like the place I thought I was going when I applied.

You know what, OP?  Fuck you and your fucked-up sense of superiority.  Because all these girls are dressed alike, they clearly all think alike, are all the same person.  Because they're CLEARLY not real, complex human beings with emotions, problems, and a personality.  You just choose to ignore that fact because it makes it easier for you to generalize them into a group of "people whom I can look down upon"

you should re-examine your own life if you need to stereotype and dehumanize an entire group of people in order to feel good about yourself

Fuck society for making people think this is okay practice and fuck you, op, for perpetuating it

I am just going to throw this out there - but in general, large masses of people suddenly showing up to a specific location without any prior warning really bothers me, which I think is what is setting some people off. Yes, mobbing places sometimes is okay - but there has to be a level of acceptance and familiarity by the receiving party. It does not matter gender and/or stereotypes. It is a matter of curtesy.

The polite thing to do would have been to notify Olin (and its students) they were doing a photo shoot so that we all could have gotten a heads up about what was going on. Like any other non-Olin-student organized activity that happens on campus - especially since we are a small one.

Large plywood letters with no prior warning or context really annoy me. Especially when they're in festive fonts. How are we supposed to know what's going on? Is that a sigma or a crazy E? Yes word art is sometimes ok, but I'm really more comfortable with 12pt or at max 36. It would have been nice to get some explanation, especially since our campus looks so small next to those giant letters.

I leave for four months and this is the best we came up with to complain about? That really annoys me. Especially when there are much more serious things to complain about. How are we supposed to change anything? The occasional hilarious "fucking hell" email on therapy is okay, but it's much better when it's something that pisses everyone off universally instead of causing another round of fucking snowman jokes and a snarky reply all to a carpe. It would have been nice if this actually was funny, especially since our campus doesn't have too much to complain about anyway.

Okay, to be fair, there are some really dickish Babbies who have been known
to be a problem in the past. Now, these are probably not those Babbies, but
there is a legitimate underlying complaint.

I leave for four months and this is the best we came up with to complain about? That really annoys me. Especially when there are much more serious things to complain about. How are we supposed to change anything? The occasional hilarious "fucking hell" email on therapy is okay, but it's much better when it's something that pisses everyone off universally instead of causing another round of fucking snowman jokes and a snarky reply all to a carpe. It would have been nice if this actually was funny, especially since our campus doesn't have too much to complain about anyway.

In fact, the most recent fire alarm was tripped by smoke from a small fire built by every senior adding a toothpick to a pile, then pulling a long string together tug-of-war style to remove a covering over the particle detector.
