The closest I've ever seen was when a friend suggested I switch IDs with a senior who looked (vaguely) like me.

I think that because we have easy access to alcohol here and there are no convenient bars, there's no reason for anyone to have a fake.

I'm like a week late to the party, but I know someone with a fake at Olin. So there's at least one.

Okay. I felt a little out of place with everyone else I'm meeting this
summer who has fake IDs. and wasn't sure if I had missed the memo at Olin.
