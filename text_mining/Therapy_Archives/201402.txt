Why is it that whenever I am having a good time with my friends, I always manage to say something wrong that upsets someone? Why can't people just deal with their shit and be happy?

Because everyone has different experiences and different traumas.
Instead of asking everyone to fix their problems that you don't even know about,
Why don't you try some self- reflection, 
if it's so common to offend people, it might be you.

Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE40135491F24FA@EXVS01.olin.edu>

I don't hate myself, my brain is pissed off at me and that's making me pissed off at myself.  I put myself out there, I was honest and hopeful, and I was turned down.  And now I feel like an idiot for it.  Now I'm shifting how I look at myself and other people and our interactions, and my brain doesn't want me to be doing that.  Even worse, the person who would most understand what I'm going through is the one person who I'd hurt by talking to about this.

So instead I just have to cry when I'm alone and wait for my brain to stop getting pissy and let me see the world how I want to.

So I recently made a bunch of money on the stock market, and I honestly just want to brag about it a little. Anonymously.
In the last few weeks, I've made something like 18 grand just by following my gut on a buy and sitting on my ass. It feels good. </brag>

Is there anything that you'd like to brag about, anonymously?  Consider this like a confession bear or socially awesome penguin or whatever advice animal you feel fits your story best. But I want to hear some good boasts. And it'll be all the more fun that you probably know everybody who responds or reads it. So go ahead!

Sadly, I'm pretty sure most of the things I want to brag about anonymously
are odd enough that bragging about them would break my anonymity...

While I was doing some reading today, I came across this sentence: "The "community" internally maintains an image of itself as "diverse" by hyperfocusing on small differences within a fairly homogenous population rather than noticing larger ways that their group, as a whole, differs from others who engage in similar activities."

It was in a context completely separate from Olin or college, but I thought it applied so well.

Last night, my professor emailed me, said I should either drop or take it pass/fail. Because I'm clearly going to fail.
I can drop the class
The add period at every one of the schools has ended

You might be able to add a class if you get the professor to let you in.
Professors can often ignore deadlines.

It's an organization, so it's naming names. Olin students in general is not a self-identified olin organization. You can look up a list of people that are in SWE and pinpoint who is the main lead, and who likely is making decisions on the groups behalf. Be a good sport, understand that if you say something offensive towards the group, there will be people who feel personally attacked.

To answer the original question (which wasn't even hostile towards SWE in any way): SWE always hosts the open house in WH. The open house needs a body of organizers, and SWE is typically the group that does that.

SWE always hosts the open house in WH. The open house needs a body of organizers, and SWE is typically the group that does that.

Is there a history of this? I remember SWE doing cookies in the kitchen before but never having an official hosting responsibility. AFAIK it's always been an email that Admissions sends out requesting that we make open WH cool, and different clubs/ hallways band together to entertain the first years.

I don't recall SWE ever being the hosts.

There have been a lot of drama/charged emotions surrounding various aspects
of the candidates weekends this year and I think it is dangerously easy to
name-call in a thread such as this.

I think that Olin students that have drama and charged emotions is too specific of a subset of Oliners and is therefore naming names.

I think that thinking that naming names can happen by mentioning oliners that have drama and charged emotions is too specific of a subset of oliners is too specific of a subset of oliners and is therefore naming even more names. Check your naming name privilege.

I think that Olin students that have drama and charged emotions is too specific of a subset of Oliners and is therefore naming names.

I would also like to move to have this conversation taken out of Therapy.
There have been a lot of drama/charged emotions surrounding various aspects of the candidates weekends this year and I think it is dangerously easy to name-call in a thread such as this.

Subject: [Therapy] Income inequality in top colleges
Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE401359824AB4C@EXVS01.olin.edu>

"This broad view of the world's economic reality suggests that elite universities should not be asking, "Why do we have so few low-income students?" but "How do we have so many wealthy ones?" There is no relationship between being intelligent and inheriting wealth.  Therefore, the only logical explanation for the disproportionate abundance of wealthy people in elite colleges and universities is that these private institutions consistently overvalue the performance and qualifications of youth from higher income brackets. "

How do you think Olin stacks up?
