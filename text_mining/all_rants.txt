come wash, fold and iron my laundry, i'll pay you about $10 an hour.


i would totally do your laundry for $10 an hour.



was that totally necessary? i think it's fair to backlash against babsoners that are douchey. but do you need to mock them out of boredom too? not cool.

is there something else bothering you?
is there something that sprung this comment on?

making fun of a group of people because you find yourself superior is the equivalent of bulling. you're not better.




there are 350 oliners, we do laundry on average probably once every two
weeks...which is ~ 700 loads a month. assuming an hour a load, a $7k/month

and it was triggered by this service, which is not available here.

never knew bullying had anything to do with superiority, i always assumed
it was the group aspect.

   use superior strength or influence to intimidate (someone), typically to

last year, i experienced depression. i spent a lot of time alone during it, and it was comforting.

now, i want the emotional comfort of that alone time, because i'm not emotionally fulfilled. i'm not really depressed though, and the alone time isn't doin it for me. hanging out with friends doesn't help either, because it's fun, but not fulfilling. i'm just unhappy that i'm not finding comfort in the things that used to comfort me.

the slightly more concerning part of this is that, in the past, i've turned to casual sex or unhealthily intense relationships for gratification, both of which seem bad. i want to be my own person.


then do it



now i'm scared as fuck


me too


real subtle, guys.



why is it that whenever i am having a good time with my friends, i always manage to say something wrong that upsets someone? why can't people just deal with their shit and be happy?


because everyone has different experiences and different traumas.
instead of asking everyone to fix their problems that you don't even know about,
why don't you try some self- reflection, 
if it's so common to offend people, it might be you.



i don't hate myself, my brain is pissed off at me and that's making me pissed off at myself.  i put myself out there, i was honest and hopeful, and i was turned down.  and now i feel like an idiot for it.  now i'm shifting how i look at myself and other people and our interactions, and my brain doesn't want me to be doing that.  even worse, the person who would most understand what i'm going through is the one person who i'd hurt by talking to about this.

so instead i just have to cry when i'm alone and wait for my brain to stop getting pissy and let me see the world how i want to.


so i recently made a bunch of money on the stock market, and i honestly just want to brag about it a little. anonymously.
in the last few weeks, i've made something like 18 grand just by following my gut on a buy and sitting on my ass. it feels good. </brag>

is there anything that you'd like to brag about, anonymously?  consider this like a confession bear or socially awesome penguin or whatever advice animal you feel fits your story best. but i want to hear some good boasts. and it'll be all the more fun that you probably know everybody who responds or reads it. so go ahead!


um, wow. do you do that consistently? mind giving me some tips?

sadly, i'm pretty sure most of the things i want to brag about anonymously
are odd enough that bragging about them would break my anonymity...



me (f) : "i feel like having something hanging there would be so uncomfortable"

person (m):" "yeah but it makes peeing while running from large animals a lot easier"

me (f) :"wait, have you done it?"

person (m) "no, but it seems like it would be helpful!"




nope, first time. invested in medical marijuana, got money. good job me.

while i was doing some reading today, i came across this sentence: "the "community" internally maintains an image of itself as "diverse" by hyperfocusing on small differences within a fairly homogenous population rather than noticing larger ways that their group, as a whole, differs from others who engage in similar activities."

it was in a context completely separate from olin or college, but i thought it applied so well.


last semester, i got a d in the class
last week, i spend ~20 hours on the class
last night, my professor emailed me, said i should either drop or take it pass/fail. because i'm clearly going to fail.
i can drop the class
the add period at every one of the schools has ended

fuck.


you might be able to add a class if you get the professor to let you in.
professors can often ignore deadlines.



can someone help me understand why swe is hosting the open house in wh for
cw? it seems a little strange to me, is there some history?


naming names. stop!


i don't find that to be naming names. they have historically hosted that event.


"anonymous rants and raves." <therapy at lists.olin.edu> wrote:

swe is a group of people that is less than this school that can be identified. 
the fact you brought up swe is naming names.


swe is a name. how is that not naming names


would "olin students in general" be naming names?  because everyone here's
an engineer, and about half of us are women.



it's an organization, so it's naming names. olin students in general is not a self-identified olin organization. you can look up a list of people that are in swe and pinpoint who is the main lead, and who likely is making decisions on the groups behalf. be a good sport, understand that if you say something offensive towards the group, there will be people who feel personally attacked.



to answer the original question (which wasn't even hostile towards swe in any way): swe always hosts the open house in wh. the open house needs a body of organizers, and swe is typically the group that does that.



what this thread could have looked like:


is there a history of this? i remember swe doing cookies in the kitchen before but never having an official hosting responsibility. afaik it's always been an email that admissions sends out requesting that we make open wh cool, and different clubs/ hallways band together to entertain the first years.

i don't recall swe ever being the hosts.


it's been swe since i've been here.

i would also like to move to have this conversation taken out of therapy.
there have been a lot of drama/charged emotions surrounding various aspects
of the candidates weekends this year and i think it is dangerously easy to
name-call in a thread such as this.



awesome.
op here, thanks for the reasonable response.





wait, hold on a second. olin students have had drama/charged emotions in response to something? woah


i think that olin students that have drama and charged emotions is too specific of a subset of oliners and is therefore naming names.


i think that thinking that naming names can happen by mentioning oliners that have drama and charged emotions is too specific of a subset of oliners is too specific of a subset of oliners and is therefore naming even more names. check your naming name privilege.

"this broad view of the world's economic reality suggests that elite universities should not be asking, "why do we have so few low-income students?" but "how do we have so many wealthy ones?" there is no relationship between being intelligent and inheriting wealth.  therefore, the only logical explanation for the disproportionate abundance of wealthy people in elite colleges and universities is that these private institutions consistently overvalue the performance and qualifications of youth from higher income brackets. "

http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2014/02/why-ivy-league-schools-are-so-bad-at-economic-diversity/284076/

how do you think olin stacks up?


"there is no relationship between being intelligent and inheriting wealth."
[citation needed]

given that intelligence is dependent on *environmental* as well as genetic
factors, the premise of this article's argument seems flawed.


i think olin suffers from the same issues of having a rigorous application filter as any other high end school. you have to have good grades, you have to have good scores, you have to do cool things.

i'm from a poor family; my dad was a drug addict and an alcoholic, my mom worked any job she could get to try to take care of three kids. i took care of my siblings because my dad was either asleep or angry and violent any time he was hung-over or coming off a high, which was almost all the time. my dad's addiction ran over us, he would find a way to empty out the bank accounts or steal money and items from around the house to pawn for drugs. it meant that no matter how hard my mom worked, there was still no guarantee there would be food, or power, or even a home at the end of the day (empty cupboards and foreclosure notices are most of my memories from middle school and high school). and she didn't have a college education, so she was working minimum wage or less a lot of the time. if my dad hadn't been scraping the funds, we still would have been a family of five living just above the poverty line.

i was a high achiever academically, but i didn't have much outside that to put down on an application. my family didn't own a car and i went to a magnet program far from my home, so i didn't have the opportunity to do extracurriculars. i couldn't have afforded to do many, anyway. even if that hadn't been the case, i would have been needed at home- there were two younger children that needed taking care of. i still looked good enough on paper that i was recruited by ivy leagues in the name of increasing income diversity. there were plenty of other smart kids around me that didn't, though. they'd been forced to drop out to help their families (i considered this, but my mom refused, knowing i'd never get out if i didn't finish school), or the situation got the best of them and they ended up on drugs or otherwise delinquent trying to find an escape, or they just didn't have the good luck that i had to be in a low income situation but with a parent who realized the importance of an education and sacrificed a lot to make sure her kids would get one. i didn't end up at an ivy league because i didn't think i would fit in, and more importantly, i was advised that undergrad at an ivy league probably wouldn't be that great of an experience- most of them care more about their grad students than their undergrads according to the people i'd talked to. i wanted to get a lot out of my undergrad, so olin seemed like a great fit.

that being said, for all that olin offers generous financial aid, i was offered better packages by other schools (including harvard). need based aid has not allowed me the ability to relax and enjoy college, or even focus exclusively on a learning experience. my expected contribution would ruin my family, even now that my dad's out of the picture. every cent i make goes into paying for olin. i'm going to leave with a small amount of debt and basically nothing in my bank account.

i think olin's community makes it easier for people who are from different backgrounds to feel okay in a way not all schools do, and i think olin pays more attention to the stories students tell than many schools, but i also think we still wouldn't look twice at candidates who didn't have top of the line qualifications but had to fight to get what they did have to show because of their situation. somebody else might feel differently about this, though. and the same barriers that keep people from going to college elsewhere, like cost, and the fact that their families often need someone to take care of children or bring in additional income still apply to olin.


i am seriously depressed and have been wanting to take my life for a while now.

it's getting to the point where i am starting to write up my last will and testament, and am selecting a way to go out.

there are still a few things that are keeping me here, but i sense that they won't keep me much longer.

i know what is causing this depression, and my attempts to resolve these issues have failed on numerous counts. i feel that my only course of action is to escape.


please don't. if you aren't seeing a therapist, make an appointment at colony care. talk it out with someone. they might be able to help you think of a new solution, or at least something else to focus on. if it's urgently looming, find a friend, or an r2. even if it isn't urgent, maybe do that. even if it's hard to tell sometimes, people care about you. they'll be happy to take away your means if you need it, or let you camp out in their room while you get stable. barring that, check yourself into a hospital. i did it last year, it turned my life around after years of depression and suicidal thinking. 


when did you start to feel this way? did a specific event cause your
depression to come to this, the brink of suicide? how can we best
support you right now?

you're not alone in this. people care about you and are here for you.
and although we might not understand exactly how you feel, we want to
help. your life is important to us!

if you don't feel like meeting somebody in person, or sharing this
deeply personal event with somebody you know, i'd recommend calling
8778708336, which is a suicide hotline. it's confidential and
non-judgmental, and it's helped me more than once. sometimes it's good
to just talk about your situation with an actual person.


hi all,

thank you for the supportive responses. keep the community and support strong as this is an incredibly difficult situation that hits home with a lot of us. i wanted to send this email to let you know that osl is following through with the student now. r2's are here as well for any student that may wish to have a conversation or follow up of any kind about this email. stay strong and please continue the positive support.

thank you.




in before naming names, because apparently if someone emails about something that makes it impossible to discuss anymore because it's naming names.

#freebluehistorymonth


what exactly is blue history month? i didn't get a chance to see any of the posters...


celebration of the color "blue", it's history, the culture surrounding it, it's importance to the world, and the struggle it faces being such an unappreciated color in the spectrum of colors that can exist.

did you know?

blue is one of the component colors of rgb. without blue, we would not be able to make all of the colors that you see on tv.

can someone clarify naming names? roomdraw is a stressful event. they didn't say anything about coordinators or other people involved, and in my mind there's pretty much nothing that can make it not suck to some extent.

unless you meant the dick comment. in which case people are allowed to name their own names. or craigslist, which isn't really a thing that i've considered protected under the naming names thing.

haha, read that earlier today. i retitled it in my mind to "the importance of preventative care. also people who are vegetarian are also people who use preventative care less for some reason."


"our results revealed that a vegetarian diet is related to a lower bmi and less frequent alcohol consumption. moreover, our results showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with poorer health (higher incidences of cancer, allergies, and mental health disorders), a higher need for health care, and poorer quality of life. therefore, public health programs are needed in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors."

"therefore, public health programs are needed in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors."

"therefore, public health programs are needed in order to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors."

can somebody explain what exactly public health programs are needed to reduce the health risk due to nutritional factors?

i'm picturing something along the lines of putting vegans and other like-minded deviants in concentration camps.

and i'm concerned.

-vegan


my formatting didn't get through the filter. imagine the second one italicized and the third one underlined and italicized and bolded.


also they're full of shit. "moreover, vegetarians are vaccinated less often than all other dietary habit groups (p = .005) and make use of preventive check-ups less frequently than subjects eating a carnivorous diet rich in fruits and vegetables (p = .033;"

hmm, what might lead to worse health? eating a vegetarian diet? or not getting vaccinated and not going to the doctor.

but let's ignore that and say we need to warn people about the health risks of a vegetarian diet. 

it sounds to me like they found a bunch of hippies who don't believe in modern medicine, and who also happen to be vegetarian. but really, i think further study is necessary before any conclusions can be drawn.

i called them at 8:35
to schedule a taxi for 9
they said they'd come at 9:15
and i said "that'd be fine"

at 9:25 i called them again
to ask them why they were late
they said they'd be there in a few
and to just sit and wait

at 9:43 i was getting cold
my sister was getting mad
i called them back, they said 'wait more-
five minutes, plus a tad'

at 10:06 our taxi arrived
we felt a little jipped
when we got off, my sister paid
and gave the guy a tip!


i've also had a terrible, terrible experience with veteran's taxi. i basically kept calling them, getting madder and madder and they could not give me a straight answer as to when a taxi might be able to come to me. eventually i just gave up entirely and didn't get to do what i wanted to do. i would never use them again.

it's a wellesley course in a language. so, it would be no and no.


oh, non olin. 

my thought then is to think about what story you want to tell to an employer who asks about it? did you just want to focus on other things, so you withdrew? did you want to stick it out to the end anyways, even if it gets you a bad grade? as long as you can decently justify it a decent employer or whatever won't think that much less of you.

for longer then a few days,

you are bad and you should feel bad.


why? it's a parking spot and i can park my car there for as long as i want...


that's not particularly courteous to people who have to drive regularly and as a result end up having to walk/drive further. basically, you're a dick.


lot b is primarily for students who use their car frequently, especially for students who need to drive to classes at wellesley or brandeis. for someone who is driving to class every day, it's much more of a burden to walk back and forth to lots a and c compared to the person who drives once a week.

a good rule of thumb is that if you don't know you'll be using your car in the next 48 hours, don't park in lot b. 

that being said, it's not like anyone will ticket you or kick you out. you are just being an asshole and you should feel bad. 


the laziness of oliners astounds me...


lot b is only for people living in east hall.

and only for people with dark hair, as it the burden of excess sun exposure
is larger for them.






please, lot b is only for the cool kids. it's our right not to have to walk places.  who do you think we are?


did this just happen?

i mean, fuck.

fucking hell.

i thought this school was better than this.

hell, i thought we were better than this.

apparently we're at babson levels of respectfulness now. good fucking job.

i don't give a fuck if this is naming names because this shit is embarrassing and you should be well aware of that fact, and we should all take a step back and comprehend if this type of behavior is healty and something olin want's to be known for.

fuck.

we're better than this, goddammit. we need to prove it.


i was heavily abused by my parents, neighbors, and caretakers as a child.

i was starved, made to act like a dog so that my family members could laugh
at me and abuse me both physically and mentally.

i was raped by a childhood friend, and i was molested by older children in
my neighborhood while my parents watched.

i was burnt by a number of babysitters that i had. in one particularly
violent attempt i believe one of my early caretakers attempted to castrate
me, but between a vague scar and a fuzzy memory i can't say for sure if
that was their true aim.

i made three suicide attempts before the age of 10, and at a later date
when a police investigation was launched, i was forced again to claim that
everything had been a lie, and that this had never happened.

i have been formally diagnosed with ptsd as a result of this history and
have a long list of neuroses which make it very difficult for me to
interact with people.

i have long assumed that nobody at olin could relate to me, and i truly,
truly hope that i am wrong.

i'm in a tough spot and i would really love to be proven wrong, or just to
talk with someone. i feel like i've kept this in way too long, but i'm
fucking tired of not being able to talk about it.

email me at totallyanoliner at gmail.com if i'm wrong.


what are you talking about?

the fact that one of my best friends was assaulted by the people in charge of a sac event? or something else?

please clarify without revealing names.


anyone want to anonymously summarize the events


this right here is exactly why you should always take a day to simmer down before sending angry emails.

1) most of us have no idea what happened. unless you were there and actually saw this shit go down, you're not qualified to rant about how embarrassing it was. as you probably found out when you got that first response, different people have different perspectives w/r/t this event, and mudslinging when you're not sure of the facts is unfair to the people involved. 

2) even if the most commonly circulated account of the incident is correct - which is no sure thing - the person responsible already probably feels like shit. no one wants to cancel the spring formal. no one's sitting around with their buddies, knockin' back beers and bragging about that time they made a party end early. they don't need your anger to realize that they fucked up.  it's like telling an anorexic person that they need to eat more: i mean, sure, it's probably true, but don't you think they already know? you're not helping anyone. you're just making someone feel bad so that you can say you did your part as a contributing citizen.

3) therapy has a "no naming names" rule for a reason. it's not just to protect reputations; it's to prevent people from sending anonymous hatemail. what you just sent out qualifies as anonymous hatemail. that's shitty. the rules don't stop applying to you because you think you're righteously angry.

the content and style of your email smack of a hastily composed flame message. next time, please think longer and harder before hitting "send".

please answer honestly, feel free to forward.


a. i want to see results.
b. what kind of results does op expect?


does this count as naming names? i feel awkward.



no, it does not count as naming names.

the survey does not slander anyone, and is not calling anyone out in
particular. it seems like an entirely appropriate survey, as far as i can
tell.

i answered. i am interested to see what comes of this.



honestly, this survey is a bit self-selective on the bitchiest group here.

i know i personally have opinions abound.


to clarify, you're saying that by sending this to a mailing list in which people are expected to be bitchy, you think people will be bitchy? 

i agree, i just want to make sure you're saying that therapy is a bitchy group, not osl (which was my original interpretation of your sentence)


i'm just going to say, i disagree on the not naming names bit. this does call out four names in particular, even if they're not students.


personally, i think everyone left on therapy is only here because it makes their prostate tremble to tell people they're naming names.


i thought about reading this at speak.easy. due to its length and topic, i ended up going with something else. however, via a comment during the slam, this might be a more appropriate place for it. completely self-centric and really messed up. :p

as a premise: i became suicidal around age 12. i have not been "officially suicidal" for a few years, but there is the occasional relapse, which is what these last few weeks have been. i wrote this a few days ago (with minor edits). please note, i am perfectly sane and you should not be alarmed in any way.

---

when i was a kid, i had my dreams. unrealistic. bold. a bit unorthodox. when i was a kid, i wanted to be a shape shifter. i could be anything for anyone. i wanted to be "good at everything." i wanted to be the jack of all trades, but i would be different because i would be the master of all! it already seemed so easy, like i had a natural talent for everything i did. people encouraged me to pursue things, from sports to acting. from writing to math. then on that fateful day, when i was 17 years old, i put down the rope i was going to hang myself with in a sobbing nervous breakdown of realization: i wanted to live. and i promised myself i would. one week later, i started filling out college applications.

or so i tell people. the truth is, i hesitated. my plan was not perfect. i did not fully think it out. i did not know if my ceiling fan could hold my weight. i did not try attaching the noose to it. i did not even think about what chair i would kick out from under me. i am alive today because i was too uncertain to die. too clingy to my precious little existence that i backed off.

or so i tell people. the thing with memories you don't have is that you know what happened, but your own mind tosses them out the back door in some mock hope that it will help you get over it. i only remember that day as "d day" - aptly marked in my agenda several weeks in advance. i only remember going to my mother and begging behind sobbing tears to let me take off a day from school. i only remember the morning after when i could not feel anything anymore. the truth is something inside of me died that day. something i have never been able to get back. the fear that once consumed my life, the motivation that drove me to do my best. it was gone. and i had nothing left. i was nothing but a shell of a person, a slate wiped clean, a life that had to start over.

or so i tell people. sometime between 10 and 12 years old, she arrived. the funny thing is, if you are all alone, pinned down on the floor with some invisible force strangling you, you start crying out for help in the vast void of emptiness. but the problem with that is: something might just start talking back. i lived by the philosophy she began cramming into my head. rules for how to live my life, how the world worked, and my measly place in it. rules which became the truth i live by. part of me wants them to be wrong. but she was right. she was always right. d-day was the day her voice stopped, a day i was driven to because of one fact and one fact alone she taught me very well: people like me should not exist. whether i was a monster who had to be silenced before he could hurt anyone. whether he was a mass of existential waste that was destined to have no purpose. whether he was a malfunctioning robot tossed out by aliens, because who wants a short circuiting piece of junk? who wanted something broken when they could get something better. i was useless. useless things should not exist. they only get in the way. the most i would ever be was a cricket in the corner. a shadow. a leech, hanging off other people's beck and call - and how pathetic was i? incapable of living life on my own without dragging along on other people's apron strings. i was a stage extra.  it was nature. if i went against that, nothing would particularly happen, because you could never be what you never were. like characters in a book, so beautifully designed for a specific purpose. the masked faces who were one in a hundred thousand bodies just so the hero could say they had an army. some people were just meant to die.

i have never stopped wishing i had gone through with it. i have never gone a day without regretting that promise. i have never stopped being "suicidal." it is only a matter of time until it happens. i've gotten close on many occasions. end of my first year, i nearly jumped in front of a train. end of my junior year, i began making plans to wander off into parcel b right after i graduate. it's funny how easy it is to hide. i've gotten so used to it. the actor, the robot, who would notice? the loner, the freak of nature, who would care? and who had the time to breech a communication barrier of someone who had long stopped caring? who'd twist and warp words into deliberate misunderstandings? a joke of a human who would laugh off anything. who could not lie, but always did.

some people can throw the argument of god. god loves you! who cares? then he'll understand me when i go to meet him. but i care about you! that's nothing but delusional empathy. you're human. you don't understand death - chances are you think it's bad or sad, so of course you would think that. excuses, excuses, excuses. you can never guarantee life is going to get better. all you can guarantee is change. change in a world where you don't know what will happen tomorrow. people go through hell to become what they are today, but for me, that hell has come and gone. nothing's changed. it is not that i want to die. i want to live - i really want to live so, so much! you have no idea how much. but i know that some people just shouldn't. and i'm tired. tired of being the person who just did not have what it takes. tired of blindly wandering after dreams that are always just dreams. tired of being some scrap-heap humiliation of a robot who lets everyone down. tired - so, so tired - of her always being right. so when that day finally comes. when i don't have anywhere else to go, when my path runs out of road and all before me is nothing but a chasm of nothing - then i might just finally jump. she said i couldn't do it.



hey. thanks for your openness. is there anything we can do to help or support you? you do have a community behind you that wants to see that you're safe and supported. please let us know. additionally, don't hesitate to reach out to an r2 or osl for help or just to talk. they want to listen. more than anything though, please let us know if you're safe.


i am safe. nothing i know anyone can do - it's a passing phase until another trigger comes along. i can't really talk about it to anyone in person because either my voice shuts down or i can get really, really hostile (especially when i've "gotten over it"). right now i am in the "getting over it" part. so i'll probably start denying everything i said pretty soon....

have you walked through tall (like, ankle/knee height) grass lately? have you rubbed your naked body on the ground in parcel b? then you might want to check yourself.

otherwise? you're fine.

you're probably more likely to get cancer. srsly. [citation needed]

i had lyme disease when i was like five. as long as you catch it early and go on antibiotics, it's not scary at all. 


just curious.


i know of nobody who has one here


the closest i've ever seen was when a friend suggested i switch ids with a senior who looked (vaguely) like me.

i think that because we have easy access to alcohol here and there are no convenient bars, there's no reason for anyone to have a fake.


i knew someone who had a sibling's old id


i'm like a week late to the party, but i know someone with a fake at olin. so there's at least one. 
________________________________________

okay. i felt a little out of place with everyone else i'm meeting this
summer who has fake ids. and wasn't sure if i had missed the memo at olin.



a fair number of people at olin have fake ids. they just aren't the kind of
kids on therapy.



how's everybody feeling today?


i'll be honest here, i'm feeling like i'm going to burn out and it's only day 2 (really day 1 for me).


i already dropped a class, so there's that. and i have no money, so... there's that.


look around. there are always ways to make money.
and if you drop a class at this point, i think that's making a decision and planning ahead, not failing already. 


not sure if you saw, but there's a packet of student jobs and research on
the dining room tables.... some of them are paid. might be something to
look into :)



if you have a bike or car, there are lots of restaurants in needham and wellesley that would hire you.


i've always wanted to work for a restaurant... i just love food so much, i want to be with it.


how have people dealt with the fact that eh suite rooms are not soundproof
at all? any workarounds so that all my conversations, etc in the privacy of
my room don't get publicized to anyone that happens to be in my suite at
the time?


white noise machines? haven't tried them myself but i've heard good things.



restaurants also pay more per hour than on-campus jobs fyi (at least $10). and you can theoretically work up to 20 a week, depending on the place.


tutoring in needham and wellesley is highly lucrative (think at *least *$30
per hour, and often much more). if you got into olin, you are probably
qualified to tutor high school math and sat math prep (and possibly other
subjects too).



nobody's angry about anything?
you guys used to be fun. :(


i guess i'm just wondering who will actually follow the new rules.


i'm curious as to  how tables can be banned but not cups. cups, as we all know, are the number one alcohol consumption device the world over, eclipsing beer balls and funnels by a large margin. what is the olin administration doing to combat this scourge?



no more cups allowed.
bottles to the face only.


i am unsure why this is the year, after the death of manhall praise be unto him that this is the year to suddenly have a bunch of language about booze. what's next, r2s being tapped to enforce the policy, handing out demerits and detentions like we're some sort of second rate ivy?


some of this stuff was already part of olin policy--like the central source rule except for the part that gives osl a blank check to declare "central sources"--and they're now actually telling us about it. but some of it--i'm lookin at you, permissible quantities--seems out of left field. 


i keep more than 12 bottles in my room solely for personal consumption in
reasonable amounts...


did something happen that sparked the idea of new rules, or is it just osl
arbitrarily deciding to suddenly become dicks about it?

(if there was an all-students email about it, i didn't get it - i'm not a
current student)



at the end of last year, manhall got a little entitled and osl just wanted to make sure they had their backs covered in the handbook. actual policy is not really changing at all it seems.

this is a classic problem in college football (not to name my name by that reference...) where for the coaches, this is a career and they have a system -- but, the players have a 25% turnover rate, and a good coach will adapt their system based on the players available.

in part, osl doesn't see what we see -- they see a year that had a lot of perceived issues (whether they were actually issues is a totally separate point), and think they have to nip it in the bud.  in reality, however, the attitude they were hoping to change has almost all graduated.  that's why they're talking about "re-buy in" from the students, and all this talk about pendulums.

osl is strongly reacting and unintentionally creating a somewhat adversarial culture despite the fact that almost everyone agrees on the salient points of what needs to happen.

this isn't a value judgment on anyone in osl, the school now, or the class of 2014 -- it's just where the disconnect seems to arise from.


the main reason olin's alcohol policy is going down in writing is, as someone mentioned, a certain group of students who became belligerent about their privileges.  when osl had to argue with a group of students who had overstepped their bounds, it puts osl in a very awkward situation.  remember that even if you don't like osl, one of their functions is to protect us from babo when we break the technical rules.  and even if you don't like babo, one of the reasons they exist is to protect us from needham police when we break the technical rules.  

the closer to home issues can be handled, the better for everybody.  so if there's an issue, it's better to sort it out with osl with the least amount of arguing that is feasible.  escalation is bad for everybody.  osl was beginning to feel that they may not be able to prevent alcohol-related issues with certain belligerent students from escalating, so we have new language to prevent such debate.

the policy has not really changed; once first years have tips anyone at olin is free to drink (responsibly) without persecution.  just be smart, and remember that even if they're being dicks, osl is actually on our side.  and you'd much rather deal with their dickishness than babo or needham police.


+1

i always prefer the dick who can't arrest me to the dick who can.


the bulk of  the language is added as a judicial strengthening for osl.
like most legal statutes it's not written with the declarative intent to
enforce universally but to provide the *capability* of discretionary
enforcement. don't interpret it as clamping down but instead as the want of
osl to build themselves a better legal (legal = within olin's jurisdiction)
toolbox to go after people being idiots. (to build upon caselaw that they
have had trouble with, they are now able to take your keg and you can't
whine about it)

if you read it carefully they have actually eased the restrictions on
single sources, you are now at least able to get "permission" whereas in
the past there was a blanket ban.


also worth noting, they're not going to come out and say any of that. all
of their literature and guides must be on the right side of the law and
must lay out reasonable defenses against claims of negligence on behalf of
the university. (i.e. they said what they said as a preemptive legal
defense and to allow them to take away kegs when you're being idiotic)

however, pay careful attention to the fact that they are not actively
"enforcing" these existing olin defined regulations (most of what they said
was already against "the rules"). in this case and cases like it it is in
all our best interest to not freak out and ask for lots of clarification
because olin is bound by civil and criminal law to tell us that they will
be as stringent and protectionist as possible. ambiguity is both our and
their friend in this case.


storage is fucking cheap. i know what we all want is google apps with 10 gigs and shit, but even if we're never going to stop sucking microsoft off we might as well have more storage than my 2004 walkman mp3 player, or that flash drive i got in '03. we're a fucking engineering school!


or you know, you could outlook autoarchive on a daily, and then never worry about it again


it is two thousand and fucking fourteen, and i shouldn't be required to store a bunch of archive files on my computer in order to make up for the pitiful lack of space that's part of my 40k tuition.

plus, what if you need an email later? you have to dig through your 180 days worth of archive files, open up the ones you think have the emails, then pick out that particular email. 

all the while every email from sac or whatever has massive images/attachments and the fucking freshmen all have email signatures wit the olin logo in it and it all eats into my quota instead of being something i don't have to micromanage.

and yes, i am fucking mad.


just become amazing at the outlook search feature. also, you can archive to an existing archive file. i have one archive file that has 42000 emails from my inbox, basically since the beginning of freshman year (of course, that names me as a 2016er...)

also, people should set plaintext as their default email mode. some mailing lists (like the anon ones) strip down to plaintext no matter what, and do people really need formatting for emails?

first years, ya'll should get some better email signatures.


while we're getting angry about emails, it's a total dick move for it to
disable your network account and delete your email address with no warning
the second that you go on medical leave, and then conveniently "forget" to
re-enable it once you're a student again. it's not like my professors
needed to send me emails or anything...

while we're angry at it, why the fuck isn't public like 100 times larger than it is? i shouldn't every have to delete shit on public to turn in a homework assignment


my recollection is that the public's drive space is automatically scaled up or down based on space. plus, that data is very much double tripple raid secured or whatever. i bet same with our email.

shouldn't mean that we're perpetually out of space. storage is still cheap. fuck, if it's a money issue, divert like ten or twenty dollars out of our student activities fund. then we serve two puposes. less flashy money burning events and more drive space. everybody wins!
________________________________________

what i've heard is that we don't switch because if we switched, it would have to downsize -- which means firing people.

don't know if it's true, but it's kinda concerning to me that it might be.

also, plus-fucking-one on the goddamn picture signatures.  what kills storage space is the hundreds of emails that are 50-100 kb.  who the fuck came up with the picture signature thing, anyway?  i only started seeing it midway through last year. 


i would say but no naming names :(


what if we made it email culture to embed emails instead of attaching them to the... oh i know why we cant do that because we're using a mail client thats fucking ancient that makes your smilies into j's when you send an email to any other modern email client.

fuck outlook, fuck exchange, and fuck my 250mb inbox

but for serious we should probably stop putting images in emails in general. link to it or have it loaded via an html embed.

but seriously tho.


to be fair, most mail clients haven't changed for the last 10 years or so.


gmail, bro.


just forward your email to gmail! it's still ridiculous that we should have
to do that rather than having google apps by default, but i switched 2
years ago and have been so happy ever since. a lot of people i know do it
and nobody has a problem with the forwarding process. plus, if we get
enough people to forward, it makes a very convincing case for olin to
switch to apps. go do it right now, there's really no reason not to.

- derek


see, i like have seperate email accounts though... i know that you can filter emails that come forwarded, but i still would rather keep the same email account. plus, i find that google's calandar is really lacking in comparison. gcal + gmail are not integrated in the way that i'd like them to be.


olin will never switch to google apps (or whatever microsoft is calling 
their equivalent nowadays, though nobody asked for that) while it is 
under its current management.  i've heard comments from certain people 
in the it staff that they may in fact stop offering forwarding if 
significantly more people do it.  (obviously, take this with a 
boulder-size grain of salt, but that's the way they think.)

do you have any knowledge as to why that is? if this is the case, and we

sunk cost fallacy?


microsoft kickbacks?


possible.  the only reason i can remember being explicitly mentioned is 
a bogus concern about security.  (seriously, who's more likely to be on 
top of things, google's security team or olin it?)

what incentive does the dining hall have to appease the students?  everyone

if enough complaints get back to the school they would change dining hall companies, especially if it affected academic performance.


they have the continuation of their contract. if sodexo pisses off olin students, then the olin administration will (presumably) be angry as well, and there goes sodexo's contract and continued business with the school.

also, olindining.com says that they should be open at 10:30 but they
definitely weren't open until like 11:10 yesterday.

- not the op


regarding switching to gmail, that is still only a sort-of fix. olin runs on outlook. if you forward to gmail, outlook calendars aren?t viewable by others. this used to not be a problem, but then google stopped supporting syncing with exchange. 




super dumb. we should honestly press it on this issue.

also, can we, as students, prevent this type of shit from happening? instead of using attachments, fucking host your images elsewhere.

http://www.anony.ws/i/2014/09/18/whattheshit.png

this is all from just mailing lists because people think it's ok to attach a shit ton of high res pictures to their emails. not to mention all the stuff that comes though all students that's just bloated to all hell.

why isn't this in oie? i'll take 1 class on "how not to be a fuckwit with technology". 

maybe it should just be "how not to be a fuckwit". i think a number of olin students might gain something from such a class.
________________________________________

proposed change: email size times number of people email sent to is
automatically subtracted from your inbox limit.

also, mailing lists are text-only.


i'm currently attending a school with over 14,000 students.  although we
can only use shitty webmail (which is significantly less shitty than olin's
webmail), so i'm not sure what our inbox limit is, it tells me that i'll
stop being able to send emails when i hit 2gb (i currently have 38 emails
totaling 3.24mb).  there's a "technology fee" of $5/credit, which i assume
pays for everything it related.  tuition is $24/credit, so the money isn't
coming from there, and this isn't a tech school, or a school that
specializes in technology, or even a school that's stem-focused - it's a
general community college that anyone who graduated high school can go to.
 if they can figure out how to give everyone decent email space, why can't
olin?

anyway, my suggestion for all of you is to subscribe to all your mailing
lists using your gmail account - that way they won't eat up your inbox
limit, and you can continue doing things like sending emails to this list
after it's deleted your email account.  you still will need to deal with
the idiots who send all students emails with 100mb attachments, but it's
easy enough to send all all students emails to a folder that's archived on
a regular basis.


posing this to therapy because i figure we should talk about this shit. say an event happens on campus, put together by a student group.
say i think that event is a waste of our student activities fund, and want to express my outrage on therapy.
is it naming names because said event was put on by a student group, and is linked to a knowable subset of the olin population?
or lets say an email is sent out to a list or to all students, and a person is fed up with emails of that sort and decides to post to therapy.
since the email is recent on everyone's minds, it's pretty clear that names are being named, even if the general topic is something that's worthy of being ranted about.

tl;dr
therapy, at what point is the line drawn for discussing a thing and discussing a person/people?


i think the general consensus is not to post anything about someone who
could be identified by the post, even if you don't directly say their
name.  as for the line between discussing a thing and discussing a person,
it really depends on what your criticism is.  i view it as fine to say
"that event sucked", but not "that event sucked, why did the people running
it do such a bad job", but other people might not be okay with the former.
so basically better safe than sorry, if you're really pissed off about
something but concerned about naming names type it into an email that you
send to yourself, or your friend who you know's okay with receiving emails
like that, or type in a random gmail address to make a stranger's day a bit
more interesting.


tangentially related, as someone who is involved with leadership in a
student group, i value feedback and would like to hear about it. i'd rather
hear about it in person than through an anonymous mailing list, but i'd
rather hear it on a mailing list than not at all. ymmv.


ymmv?

+1 funniest fucking thing i've read all day




it's possible that "expenses" does not include salaries, which is a phenomenon i've seen in other institutions' financial reports.


as sodexo is a service provider to olin you would expect the costs to be
including the salaries of their staff.




fucking fire alarm what the shit fuck you olin god damn


the fire alarm panel said it came from the "stairway 3 corridor" so that's at least different and interesting


current consensus was a pull in the 3n hallway.


plus, last night there were some assholes with a public address system saying things at ~2am like "attention all olin students: we're crazy" or some garbage like that

guys i thought we could be better than this


we're not "better than this", get off your high horse. olin is a large group of people. this drink-the-kool-aid idea that we have this burden to be "better" than everyone else...it's annoying and condescending.

olin exceptionalism, it's wearing me thin.
________________________________________

i mean, anyone should know better than to pull the fire alarm in the middle of the night. that's not cool not matter where you are.



as someone who was awake and in 3 north at the time the alarm was pulled, i can assure that it was not pulled in this hallway. not sure where this hypothetical consensus came from but it is false

-david elkan


regardless of who pulled the alarm using therapy to point fingers is against anonymous list policy.  


thank you david.
now can we not start a witch hunt on here? if you want to point fingers, have the balls to put your name behind them.


david,

that consensus came from aj, so if you think it's erroneous, you should talk to him and nick tatar. 3n was only where they said it was pulled. no one said someone from 3n pulled it. 


i was under the impression that it was actually pulled in 2n? from people who talked with the fire department about it.

so basically i think we can all agree that we're generally uninformed about it. it happened. it's over. and now we can move on with our lives.


weird, i heard it was old man jenkins.


i thought he graduated two years ago?


fuck that.

im still fucking pissed. don't tell me it's over cause it's not. that was my one night to sleep in and someone fucking ruined it. guess who is still sleep deprived today? or is my sleep deprivation over? don't be a sjw and pretend that everything is okay and that we should always just fucking forgive eachother. someone fucked up and i had to suffer consequences from their actions. fuck that

how about the person comes clean and stops being a little fuck about it and admits to their actions. yea everyone will treat them like shit, but maybe you don't fucking pull the fire alarm in the middle of the fucking night.




how about you wipe the sriracha off your nipples and calm the fuck down.


i demand justice


tell that to the victims of isis.  babies are sold in nigerian black magic factories, the sex slave trade is alive and well, and global warming is rapidly decreasing earth's carrying capacity.  on the scale of real problems, being woken up 1 night by a fire alarm doesn't really measure up.


get over yourself. wow you are so mature bringing in the "real issues"

all i'm saying is i am mad that someone fucking pulled the fire alarm and i am fucking allowed to be angry if i want to.


nipples. sriracha. remove.


sooooo funny

this just in, no one is allowed to feel upset about something, because someone else has it worse.  why aren't you telling the sex trade victims that hey, don't be upset, at least you weren't beheaded by isis

true, this fire alarm argument in particular is a little immature, but in general, don't tell people to suck it up because "someone has it worse" and it's not a "real problem"

nobody said in general. the response was to a specific situation. shooting down a response to a specific situation because it is not generalizable to all other situations is absurd.


i'm going to poop in your sink.


then i'd be obligated to honor board your ass


i don't think honor board reports are obligatory


neither is pooping in sinks, but that never stops me.


any time i see "isis" my first thought is that people are talking about the
stupid google wallet knockoff that verizon was pushing for a while. which
has apparently recently changed its name for that exact reason.

unicycle hubs/cranks come in 2 main types... square cotterless, and isis.

isis is also an egyptian goddess - friend of sinners, slaves, outcasts - the ideal mother and wife, mother of horus - equivalent of mary, mother of jesus in ancient times who sewed her chopped up husband back together and became the most important deity because of her magic skills and general awesomeness around the time she was exported into other mythologies like greek and roman.



that is irrelephant to this conversation.

we should also use this as an opportunity to remember why we have this mailing list. 
a basic principle of therapy is support--the opposite of shutting people's problems down. 
nobody feels better when problems are belittled, or when rants are attributed to siracha on the nips. in fact, at least one person probably feels worse because of it. 


let's just establish a general consensus - do not pull the fire alarm unless an emergency because it is disrespectful of other people, especially those who are sleeping, and anger is a perfectly acceptable + very normal emotion to feel, especially when disrespect is shown.


also though if you do get sriracha on your nipples you should probably clean that shit off


unless you like that kinda stuff. sounds kinky.

what do


what's an appropriate starting salary to expect as a software dev out of
college? the company i'm interviewing with wants me to tell them what i
want. i have no concept.


80,000 base but say 90 and let them negotiate.


there's no "right" answer to this and you really should do some research into the specifics of your situation. an appropriate starting salary is going to depend on a number of factors including what type of software development you're doing, where the job is located (it costs a lot more to live in boston than in wyoming), and the other benefits and perks that are offered. the link below is to a workplace stack exchange question that has some pretty robust answers with regards to the sort of things you should consider.

the more i dig into engineers without borders, the more i don't like. they aren't filing a full 990 or disclosing full financials, no site is willing or able to give them a full review...

i think we keep giving money to them because they have "engineers" in their names, not because they're able to fulfill their mission.

i hope that serv does more vetting of it's charity choices going forward, at least beyond just names being dropped. there was an issue last year where charities that either didn't exist or were very poorly documented  made it to voting, while charities that were much more legit had to be added later.


hi, ari here.

i'm sorry to hear that engineers without borders is not as good a charity
as one would hope. they were the charity last year, but i think the olin
community has done a fairly good job of selecting different charities each
year. they've been different each year i've been at olin, i think. (i don't
quite remember what it was my first year.)

serv does a cursory evaluation of the charities that are nominated each
year, and unless we feel that a certain charity's values are not aligned
with the spirit of the olin community, we put them through for the ballot.
we can try harder this year to screen the charities, and i'm glad this has
been brought to our attention, but as this is supposed to be an olin
community decision and not a serv decision, we've tried to put as many
charities out to vote as we possibly could. i would hope that people do
their research before voting as well. regardless, i can bring it up with
the board to see if we want to enlist a stricter criteria.

i'm not sure what you mean about the issue last year - i don't recall there
being any late changes made. i have the full list of charities that were on
the ballot if anyone is interested in seeing it.

to anyone who wants more of a say in which charities are put on the ballot
this year, we'll be meeting from 12:30-1:30 tomorrow (friday) in the
mezzanine to filter the responses that we've gotten, and you are more than
welcome to join us.

thanks,
ari


can you explain what you mean by filing a full 990? they have *a* 990
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ewbgeneral/990%20-%202013.pdf> listed on their
site, and *a* copy of their financials
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/ewbgeneral/2013%20audited%20fs.pdf>... what
additional information constitutes full 990 or full financials?


related: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkso9povprm#t=27

something to think about as we select charities!


i think this is recent, they've started finally filing full 990s. however, even there, they receive over four and a half million in grants, and they end up spending around 50% of it on actually doing work (going by adding travel + their spending and adding a bit of overhead). that ratio is abysmal. this is susan b koman levels of horrid.
________________________________________

hey everyone,

if you have any more anonymous feedback on charities that you would like
the serv board to consider this year as we create the ballot, please
respond to this thread before 12:30 today.

much appreciated,
ari


i know i'm not the only one struggling with this here.  i hate myself, i'm shitty at everything, i don't deserve my spot here, i have no motivation, i'm not excited about anything, etc.  it feels fucking horrible and it's messing up my life and the lives of people i care about.  i just want to know how other people have dealt with this or fixed this. (in addition to/besides going to colony care).
: \


this happens to literally everyone at this school.  idk if you're a first-year or if this is coming back again later on for you, but it's a version of imposter syndrome.  to get my head out of that space, i personally grabbed on to one thing i know i do super well and used it to ground myself as an "i'm good enough."  if you've got something like that, it's super helpful.

the short of it is that if you are here, you do deserve to be here.  you were smart enough to get to candidates' weekend, and you were friendly and excited enough to get past it, and then you decided that this school is a good fit for you, and now you're here.

every other person at this school has felt like that at some point or another.  even if you don't feel like you deserve to be here, you've made a difference to at least one person here, and you are a part of olin, and you have made it here, and that's good enough for now.


for me, getting off campus helps a lot. it helps remind me what matters. i also set personal goals for myself. if i meet those, that makes me happy, and that's what matters. i take pride in my projects because they're cool, not because they're worse or better than other things. i don't compare myself to others. we're different and good at different things. 

call home if home is a nice place for you. if not, there were probably people who cared about you in high school (teachers, parents, friends parents, religious leaders, coaches, neighbors, the cool guy from cvs). you can reach out to them. 


so, in between "breakfast in bed" and the front page of reddit, it got me thinking...

how do ya'll feel about the dining hall? we pay a disgustingly large amount to the dining hall (2.6k per semester), which, according to my spitball math at ~20 meals a week for 16 weeks works out to around $8 per meal if you attend every meal. if you don't attend breakfast, it works out to ~11.5 dollars per meal.

that's a fair amount of dosh. do you think you get the quality out for the money you put in? what should change? should anything change?


op would also like to remind you of the following pricing structure for a-la-carte meals.

breakfast - $6.30 
brunch/lunch - $8.55 
dinner - $10.75 
special meals - $12.40

literally cheaper to buy a-la-carte instead of a meal plan.

what the fuck.
________________________________________

i'm sick of the dining hall.


so let's see... breakfast today was an hour late, and my breakfast sandwich
was not even cooked. stone cold egg bacon cheese.

the reason i've always heard that a la carte meals were cheaper than our meal plan is because we have unlimited meals.

the reason we're required to get the unlimited meals is because they "don't want us to worry about food"

if getting a la carte meals were an option for students, you could reasonably have students who eat almost nothing to save money, and that's bad for all of us.


i got called out for using the word bitch the other day. is calling someone a bitch, male or female or whatever, sexist? i don't use it in a sexist way, but this bitch told me i was being sexist by saying bitch.


quit yo bitchin

but yes, calling someone a bitch demeans women and implies that a man is a woman, which is presumably insulting (in implying that a woman is worse than a man)


in a pedantic sense of the word, yes, i agree. that being said, the word
has entered the public lexicon as a general insult and i'm not sure that it
has that connotation unless you use it in specific ways.

okay, lets do the math.

according to wolfram alpha, there are 77 weekdays between september 3rd and december 21st. let's take john/jane doe, our olin student who arrives on campus the first day they can, and leaves campus the last day they can. they stay on campus the whole time, they eat every meal at the dining hall, etc. etc. note that this includes thanksgiving break, when the dining hall is closed.

at 77 weekdays and three meals a day, one day of meals a-la-carte comes out to $25.60, or around $8.5 dollars per meal. therefore, to eat at olin every day for all 77 weekdays costs $1971.20.

but wait! there are weekends! on weekends, there are two meals, brunch and dinner. that will run you $19.30 * 32 (weekend days) = $617.60.

your total cost to eat at the dining hall literally every day for the fall semester: $2588.80

you pay each semester: $2600

do you see what the problem is now? every meal you "skip" (as well as breaks/school holidays) means that you're giving more and more money back to sodexo. and even assuming you attend every meal (even those they don't offer) they've got a 12 dollar edge on you. granted, this does not account for "special meal" days (which add 1.65 per special meal if you purchase a-la-carte), but honestly, we're getting fucked over pretty hard.

so remember when you order your burrito or go out to lemon thai that you're not only spending however much it is for the food, you're also flushing another eight and a half bucks down sodexo's greedy gullet.

what. the. fuck.
________________________________________

my math also does not account for holidays or other periods where the meals are reduced to two a day. this is a theoretical upper bound. ymmv.
________________________________________

i like the mathematical approach, but please realize that there is a lot of factors going on here.

1. when you don't eat, sodexo still has to cook that food and this still costs money.
2. sodexo cooks a wide variety of dishes (though few particularly well in my personal opinion).  sure you can get an 8 dollar meal at anna's, but they have optimized very heavily for one specific type of meal.
3. olin has a small student body which makes the dining hall model particularly inefficient.
4. the cost of raw ingredients (particularly meat and fresh vegetables) is surprisingly high.  do your research.

maybe the dining hall model isn't the right choice for olin.  what are some better solutions?

two solutions i hear often that won't work:
1. everyone just cooks their own food - dorm kitchens cannot support 300 people every day.
2. opt in meal plan - is not financially reasonable.  the number of students we have barely make the dining hall affordable for students.  with fewer students, they would most definitely have to raise the price per student, and would cycle into bad idea #1.  also puts an unfair burden on the dorm kitchens, reduces homework time.

some possibly reasonable ideas:
1. catering instead of dining hall.
2. eat at trim if you don't like the olin food.  it's 5 minutes away.
3. order takeout / go out to eat when you want something yummy, eat at the dining hall the rest of the time.

like seriously, fucking margins.

and pictures just strewn throughout. no thought to overall visual appeal whatsoever. but then. but then. you say that we should make a poster. or that we should make handouts. or that we should fucking throw out our hand-drawn shit that looks a thousand percent better.

the worst crime is the fonts though.

how the fuck am i supposed to tell you to not mix serif and sans-serif fonts? how am i supposed to tell you that the 'cursive' font you've chosen looks like shit? how am i supposed to explain that 'hand-drawn' fonts look horrible in 90% of deployed products? how do i tell you that people laugh when you use comic sans.

seriously, person. learn some fucking visual design. or at the very least, let me help you do the visual design. because you have no direction. you don't know what looks good. it's almost like you're trying to avoid coherence.

fuck bitches who don't have the balls to say shit to my face.


sexist 




woman up.


racist.


seriously? get your own fucking campus. why are the all here? and they're all dressed exactly the same. and they ruined the nice leaves in the o. they should just go away. and if they're so fucking cold then maybe they should put a coat on for their dumb pictures.


stop playing with our leaves. those are our leaves. omg.


if it really pisses you off that much, call babo and report gang activity in the o.  they're an exclusive club who all dress the same -- sounds like a gang to me.

note:  don't actually do this, it probably counts as filing a false police report. 


i can't believe how ignorant olin is.  seriously guys, grow the fuck up.  we're so fucking exclusive, we can't even consider accepting people even a little different from the rest of.  how the fuck would you feel if babson treated us that way? this is just sad, babson is more fucking accepting of different and diverse people than we are.  wake the fuck up assholes.  


yeah, i really don't think it's a problem that they're here. like
seriously, who are they harming? the o is a great place for group pictures.
babson doesn't have a well-lit place with trees and grass. it's not a big
fucking deal.


i agree that it's not a big. however babson definitely does treat us that way so...




are you fucking kidding me? this has nothing to do with being ignorant. if they went to this school here, that's fine. take the fucking picture. but they don't pay for facilities to clean up the lawn and the o. now they've left and they've also left their trash behind. literally there are cups sitting in the o now. from our dining hall. which we pay fuck tons of money for and they eat at. and this isn't the first example of babson trashing our campus. like the cars last year? them breaking into our parties? and coloring on the walls in the dorms? where do we draw the line for babson students abusing our campus.


don't forget the fucking snowman.


get it? the fucking snowman?


now, everyone stop losing their heads over this.


i miss the snowman




#notallbabsonstudents

but seriously, folks. the vast majority of babson students don't even spend any significant time on our campus. many who do are reasonably respectful, even if they have a different culture than ours. some babson students are dickheads, yes. but so are some olin students. it's all about proportions and population sizes.


let's build a bigger, better snowman this year. we should need ladders and ramps to finish it.


fuck that. 
guess who is still sleep deprived?


don't tell people to calm down. do you have any idea how degrading that is? also, it may not be all babson students but that doesn't change the fact that it's still a recurring problem. let's take this problem seriously. something needs to be done about this to make olin feel like a safer place. like the place i thought i was going when i applied. if i were a prospie and touring campus and saw a gang of identically dressed women in the o shivering taking these pictures, i'd think, "what the fuck? this is not the place for me." and i probably wouldn't have come here. let's keep olin at olin and babson at babson. i didn't apply to babson.


i have no problem telling people to calm down if they're acting like hysterical children.


if i was a prospie and touring campus and i met you going on this rant, i'd think, "what the fuck? this is not the place for me. i want to go to a school, not a cult of weird sheltered kids." let's learn how to interact civilly with other human beings.


hahaha +1 made me actually laugh out loud 




whoa, "stop losing heads" was a snowman joke, not actual advice...


omg i just got that.
loooooool


maybe you should have gone with something more obvious like, "let's not hump each other's heads off about this."


10/10 got to take a ridiculous picture of silly sorority girls in the o.
only complaint is that they left their trash.


let's talk about the core of the issue here guys. when you take a picture of a tree. it loses its soul. why are people stealing the souls of all of our trees??? this makes me sad.


+1. and olin already lacks trees!

agreed. did anyone ask those trees for consent before taking their pictures? will those trees get any say about how those photos are published?
i know it's an iconic new england thing and all, but i'm sick and tired of the way our society fetishizes trees and glorifies certain trees for their natural color.


you know what, op?  fuck you and your fucked-up sense of superiority.  because all these girls are dressed alike, they clearly all think alike, are all the same person.  because they're clearly not real, complex human beings with emotions, problems, and a personality.  you just choose to ignore that fact because it makes it easier for you to generalize them into a group of "people whom i can look down upon"

you should re-examine your own life if you need to stereotype and dehumanize an entire group of people in order to feel good about yourself

fuck society for making people think this is okay practice and fuck you, op, for perpetuating it


i am just going to throw this out there - but in general, large masses of people suddenly showing up to a specific location without any prior warning really bothers me, which i think is what is setting some people off. yes, mobbing places sometimes is okay - but there has to be a level of acceptance and familiarity by the receiving party. it does not matter gender and/or stereotypes. it is a matter of curtesy.

the polite thing to do would have been to notify olin (and its students) they were doing a photo shoot so that we all could have gotten a heads up about what was going on. like any other non-olin-student organized activity that happens on campus - especially since we are a small one.




i can't tell who is serious and who is sarcastic anymore




large plywood letters with no prior warning or context really annoy me. especially when they're in festive fonts. how are we supposed to know what's going on? is that a sigma or a crazy e? yes word art is sometimes ok, but i'm really more comfortable with 12pt or at max 36. it would have been nice to get some explanation, especially since our campus looks so small next to those giant letters.


i leave for four months and this is the best we came up with to complain about? that really annoys me. especially when there are much more serious things to complain about. how are we supposed to change anything? the occasional hilarious "fucking hell" email on therapy is okay, but it's much better when it's something that pisses everyone off universally instead of causing another round of fucking snowman jokes and a snarky reply all to a carpe. it would have been nice if this actually was funny, especially since our campus doesn't have too much to complain about anyway.

mixing serif and san-serif fonts is not a bad thing (seriously).
maybe you're the one who sucks at design...


it sounds like the issue is more just someone being mad at someone else for
being careless than anything else.


yeah it's pretty good design. that's why facebook kept it on the news
feed....


hey person who's good at visual design,

i'm bad at visual design. i want to make a product poster that doesn't look
shitty. please give me tips on how to do that so that i can avoid the same
fate as your teammate.


double your whitespace.
use good fonts
remember: you can emphasize and de-emphasize text. bold things you want to
call attention to. grey out the things that are less important. change
colors, sizes, etc to make an effect of having 2 (maybe 3) different types
of text that relate in purpose.
don't use a ton of colors. also, use colors that look good together. this
is a pretty great tool. https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/ oh, and
don't use black. pick a dark grey or blue instead. black just looks...
weird.
look around for examples of design you like and copy them.

this is not my own advice... from an olin alum erik kennedy's article here:
https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda.
it's a very good article, and though it's focused on app/website design, it
totally applies to print as well.

lastly, i'd just make sure things are aligned. even two things that are a
millimeter off are occasionally noticeable. the grid and the snaps on adobe
are your friends.


you know what?

i'm don't with trying to get people to care about/be respectful of other people (both people they know or people they don't know). for now i'm done trying to convince people to consider someone else's side, i'm done trying to get people to have compassion.

i'm just going to try spending time with people who actually care, maybe sometime in the future i'll have time for trying to make change.

sorry, friends, if you fall under one of these categories.

see subject. i don't feel carpe is the right place for political calls to action, and that a separate list might have better response/traction/be an avenue for open political discourse/discussion



there exists a politics list -- politics at lists.olin.edu.  i'm the moderator.  i'd love to see more traffic on it.  please, by all means, sign up.

-chris


agreed, i generally don't look at carpe wanting to be called to action. wouldn't mind if there was a separate place for these topics. 

what is carpe for, then? as far as i'm concerned it's just about "shar[ing] and learn[ing] how to better seize the day." 

i feel like being informed about / being called to action around a political rally falls into that category. further discussion would definitely make more sense on a different list, but it's sometimes hard to draw the line between "event updates" and "further discussion." regardless, it could be that general consensus is that carpe is for something more nuanced and should be treated as such. what do you all think, particularly those of you who don't think that political calls to action are appropriate for carpe?


 



you don't get to tell me to do something on carpe. i do what i want.

carpe is for calls to donuts, not calls to action.


gluttony was for calls to donuts. plenty of carpe messages are asking you to do things -- audition for plays, come to events, come to design reviews, help with charity events, eat food, etc.

i think it just feels different when carpe requests appeal to personal or political values than when carpe requests appeal to your stomach or sense of fun/adventure.


there's also a difference between inviting those who share your beliefs and preaching.  say there was an "olin pro-life group" -- i think it's totally appropriate for them to say "come to a pro-life rally if you think it's important!" on carpe -- i may disagree vehemently with them, but they have every right to send that email.

however, if they sent out "come to a pro-life rally!" coupled with a link to a fire-and-brimstone anti-abortion rant, that seems like the kind of thing that it's reasonable to object to.  in my mind, the key is a carpe shouldn't be making a value judgment on an individual who disagrees with any part of the poster's platform.


i'd argue that there has been an upswing of public preaching lately, especially in the reply all emails that get sent.

i am of the opinion that politically focused events are something that should be more opt-in than carpe. i disagree that carpe is truly open enough to allow a post like that without at least some level of private backlash, if not a more public one. in fact, i'm certain some would publicly reply all their disagreement. 

i don't feel comfortable having a highly trafficked mailing list be safe for only one perspective or view.


nearly any political statement runs the risk of a degree of backlash -- i don't really care about that.  differences of opinion are healthy, and i think olin needs to get over the idea that disagreement with each other is bad.  in high school, some of my best friends had diametrically opposed political positions to me -- and i think that was healthy, it forced us both to think about our positions.  i hope olin students can start to do the same thing.

i would argue the problem arises when something is sent to carpe that comes across as an attack on a group of people -- that doesn't foster discussion, it shuts it down.  fact is, if these issues had a simple answer, they'd already have been dealt with -- and only by talking about what's hard do we synthesize enough positions to move forward and make progress as a country. 


that is fine. i agree open discussion and discourse is healthy. but i argue that both carpe is not the forum for this, and the "call-out" culture of public shaming needs to stop. no matter how well intentioned it might be, you do not reply all when you disagree with someone. all it does is galvanize those who agree and shut down other voices who dissent.



hey everyone,

if anyone wants to come and talk to me about my emails to carpe about attending protests, i would love to talk. i'm around tonight or we can arrange a time. i think the bigger question is why political discourse makes people uncomfortable, rather than the age old debate about the "right" uses for the carpe mailing list.

"information is the currency of democracy."

having a place where people can speak up /and be heard by the community/ is
immensely important to a functioning community. carpe has the lowest social
barrier of entry of any mailing list in which you can invite people to join
you in an activity. with the exception of helpme, carpediem has the biggest
set of unique email-senders. this means that there exists at olin a
platform that people are comfortable speaking on, which is a huge step
toward open conversations. second, it's one of the best-read mailing lists
at olin (maybe the best? it's hard to determine if people really read their
emails), which means that it's a platform that people will be heard from.
the fact that carpe exists (regardless of its purpose) and is used in the
way it is used today means that people can share issues they care about
with others, and that others will really listen.

my first year, i sent an email to carpe about a voter education website. i
was met with a particularly nasty response that said "this is not a carpe.
where is my free shit?" i subsequently got in a minor argument about what
carpe /is/, in which i referred to mailman.olin.edu:

?carpediem: a mailing list for those who wish to share and learn how to
better seize the day.?

there are a thousand ways in which carpe can help people better seize the
day. but the best one /for people outside of olin/ is the one that opens
our minds to new ideas and concepts, political and otherwise.

that being said, a neutral point of view is often appreciated. saying "join
me and together we can rule the galaxy" is perhaps not as effective as
asking "i'm going to overthrow the emperor; would you care to join me?"
inviting people to join you in doing something is totally within the scope
of carpe, even if not everyone on carpe would like to do or approves of the
activity to which you are inviting them.

the short of it? don't say politics is off-limits for carpe. it's not, and
it shouldn't be.

mitch

ps, maybe it'd be a good idea to prohibit discussion on carpe? it seems
like discussion is not what people want, nor what is necessarily in the
scope of the list. just a thought.

pps, the most comprehensive survey of appropriate mailing list use was done
by me in the summer of 2013.
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gcdvf9thmsknitf4ivivjplrhi-wb9cudrxctrvfdyo/viewanalytics
has the results. it's not a perfect survey, but it has some interesting
conclusions, especially related to "what is an appropriate use of carpe?"


hey. question. i feel like many oliners are made uncomfortable by disagreement and confrontation.
would you rather:

a.       be made uncomfortable by discussions on social/political topics with people who disagree with you?

b.      avoid discussing these topics all together?
i'm asking this as a legitimate question.


i choose option a. i think it's the only way we can grow as people and as a community. and olin is supposed to be about change, even when it's uncomfortable...


i'd like the option to avoid--i don't want to be forced to listen to everyone's opinion about something.




i usually like to hear the opinions and be uncomfortable, but if i see other people becoming uncomfortable that makes me more uncomfortable than the original discussion would have. i guess i want to respect people who want to choose option b?


to clarify: you would choose to be uncomfortable unless there are other people there also made uncomfortable?


yeah, that's about the size of it.


can you elaborate on that? i'm legitimately curious, and the following questions are not meant to be an attack:
do you think these conversations shouldn't happen? or would you like them to happen, but just not me a part of them? 
are there other ways that you inform yourself about controversial topics? or do you prefer to stay uninformed?
if you prefer to stay uninformed, why?
would you consider changing your opinions on controversial topics, and what would cause you to do so?



(someone who hasn't responded yet)
i'm informed through facebook and stuff. i don't really care to discuss these things with olin people cause most of these issues are things that even if we came to a conclusion it wouldn't change anything (in the real world, maybe we'd make an honor code clause or something).

also i think the only thing that comes out of conversations like these is one person gets the other person to change their opinion, so that person feels shitty and the first person gets overconfident about their beliefs. at least, this is what happens anytime i've had conversations of this nature




why would a conversation or conclusion not change anything in the real world? doesn't change in the real world start with an individual?... also, i think that at olin, we choose whether or not we are part of the real world. when we choose to be a part of the real world, we can make little differences or little impacts. we can just as easily choose to keep it all in the olin bubble too.

and why should one feel shitty for changing their opinion? is there anything wrong with changing beliefs? the world moves and changes around us, so it makes sense that our beliefs would change too.


i don't think it's about discomfort.  i think it's about the fact that many of the most passionate at olin fundamentally don't respect differing opinions. 

i love debate.  i love the idea of a meeting of the minds to try and talk out a better solution, and change views.

however, olin is a community of extremists.  the fact that most of us agree with the liberal positions doesn't mean that our liberals aren't just as extreme and disrespectful as tea party conservatives.

and this is coming from a liberal -- just one who had conservative friends in high school, and knows what constructive political debate looks like.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horseshoe_theory#examples 


i sometimes wonder if (and am told that) people think my views are too extreme, or that i express them too harshly. i have been told that it can scare/intimidate people or drive them away. i would like to address this idea of passionate people not respecting differing opinions. i can only speak for myself, so i will say what i believe. i feel strongly about issues where people are mistreated by society. this includes sexism, sexual assault, partner abuse, racism, etc. i feel that it is our duty as people (particularly if/when we are in the privileged, as opposed to oppressed, position) to stand up against those injustices. i will use the example of sexual assault because i think it is what i have been most vocal about on campus.

i speak passionately about sexual assault. i speak out about survivors' issues. i publicly have very little patience for questioning survivors or "playing devil's advocate". i will have these conversation in private when we have more time and can engage more fully. and i will hear people out during those conversations. many people may be scared of saying the wrong thing and being judged. i won't do that. i am happy to both educate people and learn from them, because i do want to hear their (your) thoughts and opinions. however, when these conversations come up in public venues, i do not want to spend time entertaining ideas of survivors lying about assault or whether it's ok to make rape jokes. and i will take a stand against those, vocally, because i want to signal to the community, and to survivors in the community, that i will support them if they come forward. i am more concerned about hurting the feelings of survivors than i am about hurting the feelings of people who want to question survivors. i trust that this seems reasonable. i hope that people who may feel disrespected by this understand where i am coming from in acting that way.

i respect differing opinions. i enjoy having difficult conversations with people who have differing opinions. i think that's the only way for us (me included) to learn from one another. i want there to be controversial discourse at olin. if you enjoy talking about some real shit, i would love to talk to you, even if you think we have different opinions. i will not jump down your throat if you disagree with me. i don't want people to worry about "saying the wrong thing". we're all learning about how we want to do/say things, and everyone is at a different stage in that process. i completely respect that, especially when people want to learn. that's fucking cool.

so yeah, come talk to me and others. people are often more passionate and aggressive (someone else's word, not mine) in public venues for the reasons i mentioned above. let's talk with fewer people and i'd love to hear your thoughts and both ask and answer questions.

when you post to an anonymous list and sign your name, it effectively kills
a conversation by preventing others by responding without "naming names".

the purpose of an anonymous list is to promote anonymous discourse.
don't kill a conversation you don't like by breaking the anonymity.

even if the other person is wrong, there's nothing wrong with having the
discussion.


i don't know where you got that idea.  it's long been an unofficial rule 
that you can respond by name to someone who signed their own message.  
check the archives.

i was not signing my name because i disagreed with the other person. i was signing my name because i want to invite more conversation off the mailing list. how can i do that without identifying myself? i also think i made it clear that i specifically do like this conversation. my aim was not to kill it. and feel free to respond however you would even if you didn't know my name. you're still anonymous to me, and i don't expect you to break that.

kate (in case that was not clear) 


i grew up in a house where i was actively told to shut up or received a lecture about how unpleasant i was to be around because i had differing opinions or kept "challenging" people what they believed. years later, my family started getting upset as i increasingly ceased to "have" opinions and actively avoided their company. i was taught to not care because my own thoughts were irrelevant to the people around me - so why have them at all? and since i already knew what their beliefs, values, etc. were - it became boring and redundant to be around them because they were never people i could talk to unless i started sucking up and making them happy, or being "defiant" again to destroy the relationship we never really had.

i too am an extremist for the opinions i do have. they are not exactly things i can talk about with other people because i am lucky if i find people who agree with me. but my friends know what i believe and go with it. i know what they believe and go with it. we know arguing or trying to get the other to "our side" is not going to happen, and condemning the other for something we are both used to being ostracized for destroys trust and ultimately our relationship. if one of my friends starts a campaign for something though that i do not believe in (let's say the "no more shoes" party), i do not feel obligated to go with it just because they are my friend. that would make me a hypocrite, and it would be unfair if i campaigned to get people to do something i was not convinced of myself (eg. shoes are useful in winter). i believe this is where most oliners stand? 

but i could be wrong.... and i do not have a problem if i am. i have always loved how people are passionate about the things they are. i like learning about what other people think because i like learning. i like talking to people. i like finding out something about the world i did not know before. but i do not like people trying to 'change' what i believe, much less challenge it. both warrant a mental attack, destroying your foundations so they can replace it with something new - which is ultimately an assault on identity. people will get defensive fast. (and there is the classic argument, the faster they are to defend, the more insecure they are - though you can also argue that maybe they've been attacked too many times and have wounds you are rubbing salt into). i for one probably will not say anything to stop the conflict before it starts. why? because i am content with i believe, i think it is right, and their assault on my "ripped apart from a socially isolated childhood only to be carefully re-established after going through hell with 4 split personalities to finally come to like who i am today, so you better believe i thought long and hard about it" identity is not welcome - and then they become the ignorant, uncooperative idiot who is wasting both our times. 

but i am willing to consent that there may be things wrong about it because there are many people who believe things i do not. it is hard to say who is ultimately correct without hard solid facts (or so i believe :p). yeah, i play devil's advocate a lot - because i am curious and ignorant, so i ask questions to help broaden my scope. i like when people ask me questions too, because it helps me reflect on what i believe and better articulate it for the future. i should make it clear though curiosity is not a challenge. i think devil's advocate gets a bad reputation for that. a lot of the time, the ignorance part translates to being rude or offensive, which i am hopefully getting better at.

shutting up now....


you can totally respond to people who sign their names. there are just different standards because you're talking to a person, not spouting ideas. so you can disagree with an individual, but you probably shouldn't call them a shitting dicknipple or threaten to stab them with a frozen poop like people often do on therapy.

did my doctor notice the split second of hesitation before i told him i had
no history of depression?

why is it so hard for me to admit it? especially in a situation where i'm
being given a medication that is known to cause depression and suicidal
thoughts, i would think i should have what it takes to be honest.

i'm fairly comfortable with that part of myself at this point, or so i tell
myself...


why are you doing this?


look, there's this wonderful thing in the world called the doctor-patient relationship. it's been enshrined into law, and it says that what you say to your doctor stays with your doctor unless you are threatening to hurt yourself or others.

i'm not telling you what to do. but i'm telling you that especially when dealing with your doctor, that is not someone you want to lie to. at all. depression is like any other illness. if you had stomach ulcers and had to take a drug which aggravates stomach acid, you'd tell your doctor. if you were at risk of stroke, you wouldn't let your doctor give you medicine which might cause strokes.

it's tough to do. i know. but if you're fine with telling ~320 people anonymously this, you can tell your doctor.

i can hear my neighbor having sex. so loud. how to beds here make that much noise? how do grunting noises travel so clearly through walls?

also, who has time to have sex during finals? i haven't had time to sleep in the past few days, let alone think about sex.

oh great... it's getting louder.


i'd answer those questions but someone is currently riding my meat-log down splash mountain.


our beds really do get squeaky over time. with enough sex.


their solution to my inbox being "almost full"?

send me another goddman email about it.

i'm scared to work there now. even scarier: my soon-to-be boss is telling me "you might be working on outlook web access, ever heard of it?"

yes. and i'm afraid of what about it is keeping it from becoming anything useful.


olin is using a hugely outdated version and the limit is mostly olin's
fault.


yeah current outlook web access is very... metro-y. and not horrible.
actually kinda springy.
but so much of our storage limits are super arbitrary...
why don't we just do google apps again?


because we fellate microsoft more than we fellate google.

i somehow doubt that that's the reason.


i dunno why, but i haven't lately. i think i need to reduce my screen time before bed, because it's seriously fucking with my ability to stop thinking and stressing about every little thing that's on my mind. anyone else like this?



yep!


do you work in your bed?


<speculation>
the prevailing theory that has gone around on therapy, slac, and by word of
mouth, is that the problem lies with it. i don't believe that fellating
different companies plays into it as much - google apps for education is
free and requires no hosting, so from just a company-vs-company standpoint,
there's a lot of undeniable advantages to switching. (office 365 is the
same, but we're not using that.) people have previously cited security
concerns, potential loss of it work, and similar as why we don't switch,
but my personal belief is that we haven't switched because nobody has taken
on the cause (or if they have, i haven't heard about it).

it has a lot on their plate. my opinion is that they do a phenomenal job on
a lot of things at olin - infrastructure, etc - and, as anyone who's done
sysadmin work before should know, it takes a hell of a lot more time than
you'd think to fix problems and migrate platforms. switching to apps would
be a lot of work. so would switching to 365. if there isn't a concrete push
to change the current system, they're unlikely to change it out of the blue
because of the cost and because there isn't a clear need.
</speculation>

that being said, i'm fully behind the idea of switching to a cloud-based
service (i mentioned that earlier this year when this came up.).

if you're serious about it and think we should take it on, email me.

if you're strongly opposed to switching, tell me why. so far, people have
mainly objected to loss of calendar functionality.

so, read an interesting article on buzzfeed, i know, a rarity. (and you won't believe what they wrote!)

it was talking about stanford students making a ferpa request for the documents pertaining to their admission to stanford, and suggest that other students try it at their own universities.

note that while most of us waived our rights to see the recommendations through the common app, that doesn't pertain to their deliberations after the fact, or, in fact, the candidate's weekend information (which i'm the most curious about).

i'm going to make a formal request for information when we get back on campus.

is anyone else curious enough to give it a shot with me? think i'm being a giant dick?

article: http://www.buzzfeed.com/mollyhensleyclancy/heres-how-to-see-what-college-admissions-officers-wrote-abou



i'm up for it just cause i'm curious what they'll say.

brian




interviewing for cw, they definitely told us that what we wrote about the candies wouldn't be seen by anyone outside admissions, so there's also that privacy to consider...

i don't want to know what they said about me, mostly because i know it's really hard to judge someone from an application, and i'm honestly not interested in what people who don't know me think about me...maybe that's just me.



the response below brings up a good point - the professors, students, and admissions people wrote things in confidence about people they just met. if you read what they wrote, it has the chance of changing your opinion about those people and that doesn't seem fair. olin isn't like stanford or harvard where students will probably never meet the people who read their applications and they may never even run into their interviewer again - we know the people who decided to accept us to this school. 


also, who cares?  you got accepted, came to olin, and who gives a shit what they said about you?

i think the need to know exactly what someone who clearly liked you enough to let you in said probably reflects some deeper insecurities that you should think about.


i think it's the potential for improvement. i almost want accepted, and i'd
like to know why. i may just do that...





wasn?t happening 10 minutes ago. unlikely to happen tonight.


to think that only yesterday
i was cheerful bright and gay
looking forward to (but who wouldn't do)
the role i was about to play
but as if to knock me down
reality came around
and without so much as a mere touch
cut me into little pieces
leaving me to doubt
talk about god and his mercy
for if he really does exist why did he desert me
in my hour of need?
i truly am indeed
alone again, naturally.


just to clarify, bonfire cannot happen in the snow fort.  very small fire and tea lights are fine, but an actual bonfire would ruin a lot of hard work


also sounds pretty dangerous and i'm sure the school wouldn't appreciate it. 


better idea...bonfire in the o!


i had a really emotionally taxing dream last night, and i feel that i need to tell this story for some closure in my life. most olin people don't know this story - not because i don't want people to know, but because there's not really many situations where it would make sense to tell people. i think that if people at least know the following story, i won't feel like i'm keeping a secret. i'm keeping this anonymous for now cause i don't want to make a big deal of it - this is more for me to feel satisfied than for you all to figure out who i am.












i am the real slim shady.


just kidding. here's my story:
my dad died pretty recently. he died when i was 16, 3 days before my 17th birthday. he died of a heart attack the morning that he woke up to take my brother to the airport to take him to college for his freshman year. my brother saw him on the couch, and ran to my mother to tell her my dad had stopped breathing. 

this all happened very early in the morning. in my dream that morning, i heard ambulances in my dream and had dreamt he died in the exact situation that he did. i was woken up by my best friend's mom and my mom by my bed side. my mom, a very strong smart woman, had to leave the room when my friend's mom told me the news between small cries and sniffles. i had never before seen either of these women cry, nor have i since.

my dad was an awesome, fucking truly awesome person. he was just like one of those people who was just plain awesome. he was a fantastic father. i know some people have issues with their parents or don't have the best family lives. my dad was the pure perfect father. period. he was a stay at home dad once he retired from selling his own business when i was very young, so he was very present in my life. and while he was a little overweight, he always made sure he would play with us even if it made him exhausted.

that day i went to volleyball after to try to get my mind off things. i walked around my house and tried to clean things up a little, i just felt like i had to do something. the whole day was a surreal blur, seeing people i hadn't seen in years in my house bringing my family food. that's one thing i remember clearly. tons and tons of food.

at his funeral, i read a speech i had written onto his facebook page. sometimes i feel bad that i didn't write a better speech for the service. my mom couldn't finish her speech and my older brother had to finish it halfway through. the funeral hall had a capacity of around 600 people i believe, but as we walked out people were crowded into every space possible in and around the building. i talked to people for probably 4 hours after the service just so that i say hello to everyone.


i'm fucking pissed. im just upset at life. there are so many things that we could have done. there are so many things that we did that i want to do again. i want him back in my life.

last night i had a dream where, long story short, my mom died and i was with my dad. same look, same personality, everything. and i felt happy, truly happy, for the first time in a while. and it sucks cause i'm crying again as i write this now cause this death was really fucking hard on me. we went to visit his grave as a family and i cried, and i just couldn't help myself. i think the worst part is that when my dad was alive, my mom was my favorite and he knew it.

and it isn't a competition on who's live is harder or anything, but i'm sick of the bullshit that people tell me about his death and how he's in a better place or life is hard or whatever. he didn't deserve to die. there are people that die that have accomplished their life and it's time, or might be bad people. my dad was a great person. he was the perfect father. and he's gone. and everyday i'm afraid that my mom might go too by freak accident, and i don't think i could live yet.

so that's my story. i feel much better writing this down because now it's real. it's on (electronic) paper and not just in my mind. thank you for reading my story.


the school thought i was going to murder my parents because i wrote a short story based on "the veldt" by ray bradbury. never mind that it was a fucking assignment that you had to write a story in the style of one of the short stories we read as a class that year. nope, definitely parent murder.

i remember crying more at the thought of my parents dying than anything else that day.

basically parents dying sucks. i sometimes get in that shitty headspace where i wonder what it would be like if my parents died like, tomorrow. definitely not good pre-bedtime thinking material.

i feel for ya, man. people die and they die at the wrong, most bullshit times. one of the best things to do is cherish that part of them that you remember, and carry it with you. not a religious person, but a priest once said to me that every time someone dies, your memories and thoughts of them live on with you, and they live on within your children, and their children, and so on down the chain. so carry with you the best of your father, and share it with everyone, so that they too can keep him with themselves and pass it on.

what heartless fuckwits for not expressing the requisite amount of socially
appropriate sympathy for your beverage!

an upstanding person would have lapped the offending beverage off the
stairs and regurgitated it back in your cup.
an upstanding person would have immediately fetched you a replacement
beverage while you processed the emotional disturbance of the spill.
an upstanding person would have found the bastard responsible for the
shoddy beverage container design and murdered their family just to show
them what's what.
an upstanding person would have grabbed you and caressed your head as you
sobbed over your long lost liquid refreshment, whispering encouraging
platitudes in your ear.

kids these days.


"there's no use crying over spilt beverage, but getting semi-anonymous
revenge is totally legit."

while we're on the topic of stair travesties and barely-anonymous complaints, why are there crutches just hanging out and why did everybody's favorite rainbow bear disappear? 

i'm sorry nobody helped, brian. if i was there, i would have probably mumbled some amount of empathy, then given a half-hearted offer to get paper towels or something. my guess is that you just looked like you were on top of the situation and folks didn't want to a) make your day worse b) disenfranchise you by saying something that made it sound like you were incapable of cleaning up by yourself. may the rest of your day be much less entropic.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp8hvyjzwhs


i want to do a practical joke on someone. just a harmless joke that wont damage people or property. but i need some information.

what i want to do is flip the slider on the thermostat in someone's room to make the cold side actually warm and vice versa. does anyone know how to take the covers of the thermostats off in the wh rooms? there are screws holding it into place but i have no idea how to pull the square case off.

i have permission from the person's roommate and once he's really confused for a day or two i'll switch it back. please please help. this will be awesome.


isn't the critical flaw with this prank assuming that the thermostat sliders are functional? aren't the sliders just decorative?

good luck,
confused
________________________________________

i was about to say, i believe the thermostats are just a knob people can turn to do stuff. i'd take mine off the wall, but, ya know, i kinda don't want to. maybe if i'm drunk.
________________________________________

there are, if i recall correctly, two clips on the left and right sides 
of the case holding it onto the wall.  they're not difficult to remove.

the slider in a wh thermostat is a potentiometer which i think is wired 
as a voltage divider.  its output is wired into the wall, but i don't 
know whether the control unit actually does anything with that output.  
i do know that the temperature sensor inside the thermostat does control 
when the heat turns on.  (don't put your computer right underneath the 
thermostat.  the warm air coming out will produce a false reading and 
the heat will never turn on.)

bad news for the prankster is that you can't "flip the slider" because 
it contacts directly on the circuit board.

freshman at babson died on thursday, too. they don't know how. :(


don't take this the wrong way, but... 		so?

150,000 people die on average every day and most of them didn't get to go to babson or wellesley college. why do these events matter at all to anyone here (unless you know them)? are you going to worry about every person that dies every day?


yes




yeah, preventable deaths are still a pretty shitty thing, especially if it's potentially suicide (which means that there's a harmful and/or unsupportive structure happening in our society that should be addressed). 

better to do what you can than go straight to nihilism and say fuck it nothing matters.


that moment when you realize that you're not going to really connect deeply with others while you're here (or maybe afterwards, but that's a big fat unknown). you've had it and lost it, and you've never felt a deeper loneliness, even while surrounded by friends, who care.

to be 100% fair, we haven't had a solid monday of classes for a while, so a lot of courses are very behind...


but it's still bullshit.



we shouldn't be complaining... we're at olin, where we can walk anywhere in
a hurricane or a blizzard and still be safe. we should be thankful to our
professors, who are home with their own kids and have a lot more on their
plates than we do as college students, since they are taking the time to
teach us even though it's a snow day.


honestly i'd rather have classes. the work has to get done anyways...


well said. but it does feel good to complain about it just a little in an anonymous forum.
i, for one, am grateful i don't go to babson where some profs are apparently running snow day classes via webex.


therapy, i want to hear about the little things that are pissing you off. nothing too big, this is about trivial shit.

like, for instance, i hate how things are delivered to olin, but it takes a day for me to get an email about it because when it is delivered, its actually delivered to the post office and not to olin, and so facilities has to pick it up and bring it to olin, but they visit in the mornings, and the packages are delivered by midday, so i have to wait an extra day on all of my amazon prime packages.

fuck that shit.


mailroom: once, they forgot to send my e-mail and i didn't get my package
until my next package arrived (a month later). my parents had thought they
were being so clever, sending me surprise brownies without mentioning it.
unfortunately, the brownies were covered in mold by the time i picked them
up.


it seems that people never think to turn the damn lights off. seriously, it's not that fucking hard, and it's pretty much the least you can do. turn the lights off when you leave.

do people just not care? it's kinda the first and easiest way to save energy, but pretty much every time i walk by, for example, the eh laundry room, several eh study rooms, or people's suites, nobody is there and all the lights are on. jeez.

and no, not all of these places are on timers so don?t give me that shit.


when people make inaccurate assumptions about my characters. 

like when a grown man talks to a child who admires him, that is "clearly" pedophilia. or that the psychopathic, sadistic pervert who has no morals and is an immature adult child, but can get away with everything because he's really, really smart, is an extension of my inner self. or that the fact that i write about killing people means i have bent up hatred for society, and the characters are people in my life i want to kill and what i wrote was out of spite. worse case was i shared a summary of my book with a homophobic, who assumed one of the girls was a guy and i was writing a gay love story - a very brief fight ensued.

that said, i now have a female pedophile and a gay criminal married to a police officer included as some of the major characters. give the people what they want.

hey therapy,

there's a conversation happening on the empower mailing list about a potential event idea, and i wanted to get some more opinions on it. here's the basic idea, though any details can be discussed.

students, faculty, and staff are invited to anonymously submit stories around the topics of consent, bad/embarrassing/whatever sexual experiences, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, relationships, partner abuse, harassment, etc. anything in that space. during the actual event (maybe during serv time?), people gather in a semi-private location on campus and volunteers read the stories. people are also welcome to read their own stories.

what do people think? would you like to see something like this, or a variation of it, happen on campus? would you attend? would you submit a story?

i'd love to hear your thoughts :)

doors fucking suck. 


one day soon, we will awaken to blocked doors on all sides. it's already happening in the ac. the ground is literally rising up against us. soon we'll all be trapped inside.


the lower level east wing door of east hall also won't open because the ground has risen too much. i'm just grateful we've got upper-level windows that don't actually prevent people from jumping out of them and lots of snow to cushion our falls, so we probably won't be perma-stuck.

  february 20, 21 and 22
  february 27, 28, march 1

sorry clicked send accidentally.

for everyone who's been curious why babson folk just happen to not show up during candidates weekends.




dining hall, just because you put it on a plate, does not mean i will eat it.

if grow or whatever really wants to cut down on food waste, they'd put a stop this bullshit pre-plating business with crap i don't want to eat on it.

like, you'd have a piece of meat or something, and you'd bundle it up with a shit ton of rice, or crappy root vegetables or whatever.

i understand it's more expensive, but i literally will take more plates and throw away more uneaten food because you think it's a good idea.

hopefully they'll learn someday.

probably not.


i love when my jaw dislocates because the food is so tough. i eat what my mother puts on my plate because it's delicious. i get more food than i want at the dining hall because i know some of it will be inedible, that i promptly throw away when i confirm that it is inedible.

what, you don't enjoy 30 different kinds of rice at every meal? i thought that was a vegetarian's dream come true? /s

i actually don't know who was out there, but i support them trying to enjoy the snow that got shat all over us. 
i also don't know who op is except some bitter sad person who can't stand the sounds of happiness.


honestly, i think we should respect people's desire for quiet at late hours on a school night. maybe 12:15am is early for some people but if op is trying to sleep or work, i totally understand their annoyance at loud people. 


personally, i think fascist bandwagon is a fantastic idea for a band name.

oh and i think people are right to complain here or elsewhere or something like that.


i'd like to register a complaint about people complaining about people complaining on therapy. </meta>


are you implying that early sleepers would be less likely to bring up the issue? or are you implying the other direction, that the issue would not be limited to the therapy mailing list?

hear that? the fascist bandwagon is a-comin down the street.


i believe, ladies and gentlemen, that with the aid of the previous comment
we have formally renounced our dedication to any utilitarian strictures and
have instead fully entered our own assholes.


i was disappointed and upset to learn that this year's design challenge entails having the entire school run through the ac "screaming at the candidates".  (i was outside wh when it happened and heard it clearly across the campus.) i can only imagine the amount of unnecessary stress this caused. it's part of a larger, older trend where olin students act artificially wacky for the design challenge.

i have to wonder what effect this has on how the candidates view us and our school. for a lot of these kids, this weekend is when they decide whether or not they want to come here.

-concerned student


agree 100%. this is not the way i want my school represented.


as someone who used to have ligyrophobia, +1 for the stress.



+1
and, this is a more minor complaint, but i think the hunger games theme is kinda tacky for an activity that's supposed to represent olin.


i hated my candidates weekend for all of the over-the-top wackiness and excitement, and that was 4 years ago. the best part was hiding in the library during the interview time block and reading books quietly. i think we?re effectively narrowing to only the extroverts, but is that really good for olin?

i?m glad i came here, but definitely wouldn?t have if i hadn?t revisited.



can a few people talk to the candidates over dinner and collect actual
feedback? we could then share with the committee.

i hate to say this, but if you want to make this change, you have to be a part of the planning, which is, again, open to everyone.
________________________________________

why do you hate to say it?


because that's the default answer to anything going wrong on this campus.
________________________________________

i think that?s true, if i wanted to make change i should have done something, but candidates weekends are still way too intimidating for me and i try to be as far away from them as possible even now four years later. i also don?t know if there is anything we can do given the key elements of the candidates weekend (such as the design build) to make it more welcoming to introverts. with no good ideas for how to change it, the best i can do is talk to candidates when they revisit and convince them that it?s ok to be an introvert here. 



it would be nice if big decisions, such as the theme and rules were discussed in a more open way. for example, the design challenge committee could send a survey with their top three theme ideas. maybe there could be a mailing list for general discussion of the rules and plan for how the challenge will happen? this would let a lot more people participate, open opportunities for more people to contribute--regardless of personality and time commitments, and make the whole process much more open and well communicated. this would help the design challenge accurately reflect the desires of the full olin community, and current students not feel off-put by the process. i think the design challenge is something a lot of people care about. for a plethora of reasons, not that many people actually contribute. anything we can do to lower the barrier to contribution and help ease the burden on those organizing it would be a positive change. 


________________________________________

as someone who has been heavily involved in design challenge planning in 
previous years, i'd love to "lower the barrier to contribution" but i 
don't believe that either of these ideas would "ease the burden" on the 
organizers.  it's hard enough to come up with a single workable theme 
idea, so either the survey results would get ignored when the most 
popular idea doesn't work out, or else the planners would have to put in 
a lot of effort trying to save a bad idea just because it was popular.  
the discussion list would probably be less harmful, but i think it 
wouldn't make as much difference as you expect to how happy people are 
with the result.

honestly, i don't mind the way the design challenge is planned. but i think in this case there's one particular thing--screaming--that people take issue with. i think it would be perfectly reasonable for someone to bring it up with the committee and i don't think it's one of those cases where if you want an opinion you should have been there in the planning stages. i'm fine with leaving most of it up to a committee, because i wouldn't have anticipated that they'd decide on something i disagree so strongly with. i think it's within our rights to respectfully suggest that they consider taking out that part of the challenge.


the problem is that the planners this year clearly didn't do a very good job of putting themselves in the candidate's shoes.  there are two things that anyone who'd even bothered to put themselves in the frame of mind of an intimidated high school senior would have rejected about 10 seconds after they thought of it. 

- "scream at the candidates" is very hazing-like.
- hunger games, which is literally kids killing other kids, does exactly the opposite of what the design challenge should -- "we want you to collaborate, you're not competing with the other candidates!" is not the vibe you get from a hunger-games themed challenge.

i'm sure that the organizers put in a lot of work, but use a **tiny** bit of empathy and they should have realized that it's not themed in a friendly way.


also going to throw it out there, on the comment: "if you don't like something, then change it or be involved."
there are many things you may want to change - but there are physical limitations where stepping up to change everything is not sustainable anymore, and you have to start cherry picking your priorities.... 

that said, speaking up is close enough to doing something - and kudos to those who took the time to make the design challenge happen.



so i did talk with a few candidates over dinner and at the club fair.  here's what i got from them:

- one candidate i talked to was very startled by the screaming and extremely confused when all of a sudden she was wet and only realized after that it was because people were throwing snow.  (as a side note, this was something i was extremely surprised to hear and seems really, really inappropriate to me, and i'm rather upset that that happened.)

- the same candidate said she figured this was some sort of hazing thing.  (again, i'm not particularly happy about that.)

- a couple of candidates at dinner said that it felt like a really weird thing to be happening, but that they didn't particularly mind.  

- other candidates that were around at dinner seemed uncomfortable to be talking about it.


overall, this doesn't seem like it was a good experience for them.  nobody seemed to care about the theme, but the screaming and surprising them seems like something that should go away for next weekend.  

i personally didn't join in on it, but i feel bad.  this seems like it wasn't a particularly good impression that we made, and it's not like we were trying to cause any harm, but that we kind of made a mistake making it happen.  is there some way that we can send an email or something to the candidates and be just like, "hey, we were kind of idiots.  we did this thing and we probably shouldn't have done that thing, and it wasn't the best way to introduce you to olin.  we know this doesn't fix it, but we swear we're not jerks and if you're still at all potentially interested, please come visit us later on and we can show you the parts of olin you might like better than what we have already."  i feel like that could mean a lot to the candidates that this affected.  


hey guys.
sounds like there's some good discussion here. i don't know if anyone on the design build committee is reading this thread, but it might be worth bringing up to see if other people feel this way. if anyone here has comments that they want passed on anonymously to someone on the committee, i'm willing to do it. 
let me know.

- adriana


someone from the design challenge committee is reading this thread. we recognize that today got out of hand and are taking steps to make sure that it does not happen again. i think it's safe to say that the running through the building while yelling and acting crazy will not happen again (especially with snow - that wasn't cool either). please believe me when i say that we spend a good deal of time organizing the design challenge and would like to make it a fun experience for everyone. i will pass along comments from this thread to the rest of  the committee.

anonymous constructive comments are totally cool, but also, please don?t be shy about bringing any suggestions or comments directly to the design challenge organizers. we would love to hear your thoughts - both the good and the bad. thank you all for your comments, and i hope we can restore your faith in the design challenge.


+1 apology note. it will go a long way. we should talk to admissions?
________________________________________

i'm very sad and unhappy that these are the impressions they're getting from olin.  i'm sad that it happened, but this is definitely going to be changed for the next two weeks, right?


can we try a design challenge where we discourage wacky clothing, riding
around on bikes, yelling, etc? all of these things aren't particularly
representative of us...


have you seen my wardrobe lately?


yes.


i'd rather see it on the floor. 

wow that sounded sexier in my head. 


it'd look even wackier on my floor.
